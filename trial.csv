It was not unreal fast, but too fast for something flying at that level. I thought it was a fighter jet but it didn't make any sound. I was on the couch looking out the window when I saw it and went to the balcony. The object turned back south and as it came closer I saw a bright beam of light (like xenon headlights of a car, just very big). It went behind a big cloud and I couldnt spot it afterwards.

I noticed as it kept going on an upward trend straight up that there were 2 fiery streaks that trailed behind the fireball object. I picked up my phone and started recording video because it was hard to make out and I zoomed in and was able to make out the fireball shape with the trails behind it. I recorded this for 1 min 29 seconds and put my phone down to use my bathroom inside my bedroom and when I came back to look the sky was very grey and cloudy and the object seemed to disappear. I live in an apartment complex and this was seen north ! off my bedroom balcony. I have attached a link to the video I recorded for further investigation and I also noticed after watching the video 44 to 45 seconds in I seen a small metal object to the top right of the fireball but that also disappeared in seconds of recording. I dod notice 3 to 4 planes in the area prior to the siting but am 100% sure this fiery object was not a plane.

At that time, I observed an extremely bright white light, a bit lower than normal aircraft altitude (maybe 4000’) and not adhering to what would be the the normal LAX or LBC flight path, which caught my attention.  The light was over the ocean, appeared to flicker in intensity, much brighter than a star and the sun was still out at the time, but nearing sunset.  It was possibly off the coast of Huntington Beach, Ca.  As I watched, the object appeared to be completely motionless for about 6 minutes, then the light slowly dimmed and went out over the course of about 4 seconds.

Sighting was 122xxx Rios Rd, San Diego, California. We had arrived home from dinner at 18:00 driving two separate cars. My Dad and I pulled into the driveway and got out while my Step Mom was already inside. I was looking up at the the sky because it was a beautiful clear night. I noticed one round dim light that was above me traversing the sky. Object was not blinking and moved at a steady pace in one direction. Object appeared to be higher than a plane and I thought it could be a satellite. Within 10 seconds I noticed two more objects exhibiting the same behavior but moving in different directions. I felt the speed could have been similar to what you would see with a plane but the objects did not appear to be conventional aircraft due to lack of blinking lights and a! ltitude. I witnessed these lights for approximately 1 minute when my step mother came out of the house and noticed a row of approximately 10 to 12 lights, travelling west to east, about 60 degrees from the horizon and north of the front of the house. At this point all 3 of us witnessed these lights and we felt that we were observing something unusual. I watched the lights for about 10 seconds when I attempted to use my phone for video but could not capture the lights so, I went back to watching them. Some audio was captured of our reaction. Lights were dim, white and appeared to be evenly spaced approximately 3 to 4 feet between each one from our perspective. The row of lights did not appear to be one object. They appeared to be the size of small to medium stars. As we were looking to the north from the driveway, the lights travelled slightly left (north west) of us and as they reached slightly to the right (north east) of us, one by one, each light disappeared in order sta! rting with the furthest light on the right until it got to the! last on e. The total approximate time one light would travel to the time it disappeared was approximately 8 seconds. No aircraft were observed in the area during the account. In my opinion, the lights were definitely not due to atmospheric condition, reflection, flares, balloons or any known aircraft. We have never observed anything like it."

The objects were traveling above me in a straight line spaced evenly apart. This was observed for 1 minute flying from southwest to northeast and another male person working out also observed the lights. The park lights were bright which made it hard to record, but when observing the recording you are able to barely see the lights in a single row. The other male witness called his family (3 members) telephonically and they walked to the park a few minutes later but the lights were gone. However we did spot 2 more lights traveling in the same direction and both instances were recorded on an IPhone X."

The objects remained immobile but very radiant, and the mi! lky clou ds happened once more, and then around 5 in the morning one of the closest and largest objects with very radiant lights descended a little and moved a couple of times from right to left and so vice versa until all the objects lined up again and went the way they arrived I don't know if they are government drones or UFOs?

It would move short but swiftly. It looked like it was defending itself against an attack of some sort, the lightning rays shooting out of it seemed defensive, as a small blink of light would approach it, then the orange lightning would shoot in it's direction, followed by a beam of light that seemed to  travel a good distance through clouds.

It was not very big that we could tell and it seemed to be darker in color in the middle of it and then a sort of glow surrounding the glowing middle part. The middle was a sort of darkish orange yellow color and the soft glow on the outside was a bit lighter in color more of a yellowish tint. It just kind of hung there almost thought it was a street light, but no it wasn't because it just was hanging there kind of floating or hovering like moving slightly side to side but still remaining in one spot above the field. Unfortunately since we were driving, we could not say how long it had been there before we saw it, nor could we say how long it remained there either. It was a very beautiful soft glowing light.

Minutes Later,From That Point, Right Above Me, I Noticed Two Stars From Which I Thought They Were, First One (Big)Came From NorthEast To SouthWest Out Of Nowhere Just Appeared And Moved, Then Two Seconds Later The Second One(Small) Came From SouthWest To NorthEast And As Both Came In Contact Above Me, The Big One Dissapeared Once They Crossed Eachother, Then 4 Sevonds Later The  Smaller One Dissappear! s..Now If Its Military, Why Not Let It Be Known To Not Get It Confused With A Actual UFO.

346,11/25/20 05:00,Palm Desert,CA,Rectangle,"I was visiting family in california. arrived late on 11/24th. I was awakend to let my dog outside at 5am to potty. I was looking up at the sky and I noticed the stars were very visible no clouds when I saw this very very large rectangle that appeared to be right over the Bump an Grind Trail in Palm Desert. It was moving very slowly across the top of the mountains(hills with trails)southbound towards the other trail up to the Cross that is always lit up. The rectangles side visible to me had lights that almost looked like words written across them but nothing I could read. There was no sound at all. I am very familiar with planes and blimps and what they look like at night and what they sound like. At first my brain thought it was a jet airplane but it was not making any sound what so ever and for the sheer size that would mean its very close and I would definitely hear the jet noise. Then I thought maybe it a twin prop plane carrying a lit Christmas banner b! ehind it and then I realized there is no noise and that was ridiculous. I was not on any drugs that would have altered my state. I did see a hikers headlamp shine on the bump and grind trail which is common in early mornings and late evenings but that was the only other thing I could see around that area. the one end of the rectangle eventually started to disappear slowly as if it might be turning possibly, but I am unsure as to why is was disappearing"

The formation appeared distant in the night sky. At arms length I believe I would be able to cover the formation with my pinky. Which brings me to the formations shape. At first glance it appeared a line formation, as I stared closely and tried to focus, the formation had a slight bend at end. Which brings me to its angle . The approx 15 separate lights in the formation had a light amber glow to them. The formation itself appeared in a diagonal direction and they seemed to be moving away from my line of sight and the lights slowly faded into the darkness of the sky"

We could see the light through the trees and what made it so unusual was the fact that the light seemed to be as bright as a star itself. It was way too low to be a star or plane and just stayed in one spot. We actually, after much debate on what it could be and all things being illogical, decided to hop in the car and see if we could get closer. (Yes, we literally became the people in the movies that you scream at “why would you do that???”) We were able to find the light on a backroad. It was weird because the light was so so bright and we were theoretically “closer” to it, but we really weren’t. The only way it wouldn’t be closer is if it moved (but I wasn’t thinking about it at the time) I have to admit, I got a little nervous. I honestly felt like the light has a “presence” to it. And it was a very unexpected feeling since up until that moment I stil! l felt like it could be a bright fog light or something."

385,11/21/20 23:00,Seiper,LA,Formation,"Extremely vivid flashing lights. Seemed to chase us, they would flash in succession, some would be brighter but whatever it was could move extremely fast, if you were in a concert stadium with all the lights off and a dozen people were placed at different distances away from each other and they all had a camera flash, this would give an idea of what it appeared to be (on a smaller scale) at some point I looked in my rear view mirror and could see two or three of the lights right on my number, I was at a speed of about 60mph the lights seemed to disguise what it’s true nature is. I’ve been on this earth 41 years and to this day that was the single most unexplainable thing or situation I’ve been in. Nothing man made could move in such a way."

A portion of the oval/disk shaped craft was exposed from the edge of the clouds. There was a red/pink colored band faintly seen around the object. This object was massive, maybe 30-50 times that of a normal passenger jet. I have a minute long video where lights can be seen making quick flashes at the bottom and around the edge of the object. It disappeared as it looked like it formed a natural cloud around itself and went back into the cloud coverage. This was below/ within cloud altitude. Bject made no fast or sudden movements.

It did have lights, but lights that were not on earthly aircrafts...only UFO lights. As it hovered, it kind of went still for a second, and then I chose to look away...eventually looking back at where the UFO had been, but it had vanished. Simply vanished!"

There were 3 on one side and 4 on the other and they were not super bright, in fact they were barely a lighter shade of illuminated gray than the night sky it self.

A very bright “star” appeared above the horizon above the sunset and appeared to sit motionless.  I figured it was a star becoming visible, but I thought it was strange because it was so bright, it wasn't there before, and it was still very light outside.

It was hovering in one spot for a about 10 seconds when I started to focus on it. I noticed a bright white light above the helicopter which I thought was a star at first glance, but it suddenly got brighter and grew a little in size while at the same time it started to slowly move. After watching it slowly move and go from dim to bright for about 20 more seconds, it suddenly just dimmed out and disappeared. It looked to be at the same height that a passenger plane would fly at. The sky was blue as can be without a cloud in it. My question is if the helicopter saw it because, the only reason I noticed the star looking craft was because the helicopter came to a stop, which I have never seen a helicopter do while flying over in my area."

We checked to see if the cats were okay. We looked around briefly to see where the noise was coming from. The sound was nothing that we could attribute to any normal day to day sound, but was most similar to the sound of a hovering camera or something of that sort. Except it was so incredibly loud that we all woke from our sleep because of it. It was so loud and bright that we opened the front door to go outside. Opening the front door, it was obvious that the sound was external because it increased in volume. Stepping out towards the sidewalk, we saw something circular and gun metal hovering. We froze for a second and then panicked and ran inside. Shut and locked the doors. The sound continued for a few more minutes. However, when we returned to the room the clock still said 3:30AM even though so many micro events seemed to have occurred d! uring that time."

489,11/15/20 17:11,Denver,CO,Cylinder,"I had my front door open because my house was really warm from having the oven on. I saw some super bright white lights flying in the airplane landing path towards DIA. I thought that it was a very odd airplane because the lights were so bright, so I decided to go outside to get a better look. As soon as I stepped out on the porch the object changed direction and started heading directly at me. There was NO sound at all. At that point, I could see two super bright white lights that were rectangular (sorta looked like house speakers from a stereo) on the nose of this object that strobed one at a time. I then noticed two red lights on the left and two green lights on the right. I thought that they were lights on the wings, as I continued to believe that I was seeing an airplane. As the object got directly over me (about 1500 -2000 ft above), I could clearly see that it had the body of an airplane, but it had no wings! NONE! Both the red and green lights were g! one at this point, but there was a detached barrel-shaped object (Light gray in color-the same as the main object) flying close to the right side of the main object. Then all the sudden, a helicopter (I don't know if it was a news heli or a police heli, but it wasn't a military heli) flying west to east comes out of nowhere. It looked like the heli was going to crash into the main object. The helicopter flew underneath the main object, but then the helicopter stopped, turned around as if it were going to chase the objects. But after turning around for just a few seconds and getting a look at it, the helicopter immediately turned back around and started flying east again. Almost to say, ""hey, let's get out of here!"" I tried to keep watching the object, but once it went over the neighborhood houses, it flew out of my view. I thought about grabbing my phone to record it, but I knew it would have been gone by the time I came back out to film it, so I elected to just k! eep watching it instead."

We thought we saw a plane flying nearby, but upon closer inspection it took the shape of an oval. There were two neon lines going around the craft - one blue, one green - and the craft seemed to almost shrink before slowly guiding itself away from our sight. Needless to say we were very paranoid the rest of the way there, all the while talking about ways we could debunk it, but ultimately couldn't. It was 9PM by now and I had to walk back home. Then, I saw it again. It was lower to the ground this time and seemed to be swaying dramatically. The lines however were not there this time, but it had three rotating square neon lights around it.

584,11/10/20 19:43,Williams,AZ,Oval,"With a group of 5 people star watching in Williams, Arizona. We tracked two satellites and saw two shooting stars, when we noticed directly up above at the height from Earth that a satellite would be, a bright, white orb-shaped object that started out moving similar to the ISS heading south in the sky. We then watched it slowed way down, get brighter and do an odd, jerky zig zag pattern just before completely shooting across the sky like a shooting star heading opposite toward the north and then disappearing out of sight. Ten seconds later it returned coming into view directly above us again and completely stopped for about 10 seconds, then it moved diagonally down toward the tree line and got more dim as it decended until it completely dimmed out about 20 degrees above the horizon. I had no explanation for what it could be. It was speed variable (could go from super fast to stop instantly), it can dim and brighten at will, change directions instantly, no so! und, and the zig zag maneuvers seemed almost like it was blipping in and out of existance in fractions of a second, giving it this weird jerking type of motion.

Anyways one second elapses of me staring at the object and it was almost as if the object knew I saw it and it bolted off it bolted off opposite of Lake Erie it also left a trail because of how fast it traveled, the light from the aircraft was floating in the air I was at awe of how beautiful it looked then in an instant it was gone like it moved south west and had different things to do. This was my first official UFO sighting all my other sightings were coincidences and easily explainable phenmenon but it was a feeling as if I knew I saw something spectacular. The color of the craft was a reflective white looking object almost looked like a star but it wasent because it wasent a self sustaining light you could tell because when it flew away the light that it was reflecting dissipated as-well indicating it could’ve been using the lights from the city to charge up its vehicle real quick and then flew away when it had charge."

636,11/6/20 23:30,Lower Moreland,PA,Circle,"I will make this as clear as possible. My name is [redacted] and I am a high school student. Last night at around 23:30, My two friends and I biked to Lower Moreland's track field where we parked our bikes. I took a look around and into the sky. At this moment,up and toward the end of the track I saw something that seemed out of place. What caught my eye was a yellowed amber dot. However, the, ""dot"" was not blinding or irritating to the eye as it appeared to be very elevated and far away (just like any other light in the sky). As mentioned earlier, I said this dot was, ""-out of place"" but stars, galaxies, and planets are all sorts of shapes and colors, this one honestly just happened to catch my interest (I would like to describe the moment I locked my eyes on it as a coincidence). I stare at it and I notice it's moving. To this, I thought, ""Geez, is the earth really rotating that fast, I wonder if it's possible to see such a thing.&! quot;. Soon after as in seconds or a minute, the ""dot"" (to which I now would like to refer to as an object) darted in a smooth motion however, quickly, to the left, maybe right.  No matter what direction it moved in, I began to see obvious movement from the ball of light which seemed to leave trails of it's color for split seconds as it slowly moved or dashed across the sky. I would like to say that it wasn't zooming all over the sky like some crazy ufo, these movements were subtle yet very noticable, when stared at. It may have looked only an inch or two across the sky if you measured it from our eyes, but it was definitely covering great distance in each movement we saw due to the seemingly extremely high elevation. So, after this incident and observation I call it out to my friends. Here, I debate with them and we argue until we all begin to really see it. The highly elevated object or, ""ball of light"" was no plane as it moved and stood staionary and i! t was very unlikely no helicopter, due to it's appearance of h! igh alti tude, above any planes we saw fly under it. As we stood there on the left side of the track in the middle, we recorded, took photos and discussed what we had been seeing. During the time we were there, the object had moved enough for us to realize our brains were not tricking us and it really was going staionary to not stationary, and stationary again. Planes somewhat low to the ground compared to the object were leaving an airport somewhere off in the distance. Another plane sighting happened when a plane (airport plane) flew next to the object whilst still much futher below the object to which it reacted and moved away from ths plane below it. This plane was much higher than the ones we saw ""low to the ground"" and further below the object which determined it's high elevation. 2 of the ""highest"" planes were counted passing through using the dame path at different times, which were not noted. After we noted all of these things and got footage of the yello! wed, bright, and amber light/object, I wanted to get my phone to record, which I left at Friend 1's house. Friend 2 and I were staying at his house that night until further events. That aside, Friends 1 and 2 decide it is now in best interest to get home as fast as possible because of this extremely eerie yet stunning incident (they were freaked out). As I get my belongings, Friend 1 and Friend 2 take off on bikes to the right side of the field (the right side facing it from the road). Let it be known, I had not been paying much attention to the movements, rather it's position because the movements were too hard to make note of riding a bike. I told Friends 1-2 to keep constant eyes on the object. As I make my move to their side of the field, it follows. We group up and bike as quickly as we can back home, it follows and follows and follows as we keep our eyes locked on it the whole way to Friend 1's home. We reach the house and realize it is very differently orientated com! pared to where it was at the field and we draw the conclusion ! that it had followed all of us or just I. Here, we observe the object with a telescope as it had pretty much completely halted it's movement as we couldn't notice any more. Here, multiple times, I take note of red light(s) quickly appearing and reappearing in front of the object (the lights were smaller). We made multiple phone calls to non-witnesses and bring Friend 1's Dad out to see. At this moment it is 1:00am-1:30am, 11/7/2020. We decide to go inside and leave it alone. Friend 2 is picked up by the father of Friend 2 past 1:30 and before 2:00. I check the objects position as he leaves and it was still there, arguably in the same spot. Past 2:00 and before 4:00 I take a video and the object is not to be seen from anywhere we previously viewed it at Friend 1's house. The report was finished at 5:18, submitted at 5:21, 11/7/2020."

668,11/5/20 11:03,Montrose,WV,Other,"For well over a month now I have been seeing these orange or bright LED orbs where I live. My neighbor up the road has seen and managed to catch almost the same unidentified objects on film also. Last night 11/4 I was startled with a close encounter. I woke up in the middle of the night to let the animals out. When I swung open my front door I immediately seen at least 10 orbs hovering above my yard. I love in the country with very little neighbors close by, so it's always dark with no lights obstructing the view. When I looked up at them they were floating or swaying down towards the ground real slow. These were orange in colored and would fade out when there was movement on the ground. This incident scared me and I immediately shut the door and curtains and went to our bedroom. Normally I'll stay up and watch these orbs just to see what they do and make sure that I'm truly seeing what I'm seeing. I've mentioned to it to family members about these sightings! and everyone just brushes it off to be a plane which is so frustrating. So tonight I was outside putting firewood in our outdoor furnace and noticed 2 LED colored orbs across the road by the farm equipment hoovering. There was 3 over in the field where the horses graze and 5 to my left further on up the road at my grandmother's farm where the cows are. Watching there movements is incredible. It's this graceful swaying at times to no movement. The LED orbs are so bright it hurts your eyes to look at. I've pulled out binoculars to see what it could be and it's so bright. At times you can see them turning in circles when hoovering in one spot. Almost like a flashlight turning with them. I was watching one hoovering in front of my neighbors window at night(she lives on top of the mountain, me in valley but at night now that leaves are off the trees I can see her lights coming from their living room. Mt husband and I literally watched this orb hoovering within eyesight of her w! indow. We watched it come down from the sky and stay there for! well ov er 30 mins. It then slowly and gracefully lowered down into the valley and worked it's way over the cattle field also triggering a motion light as it passed right by. This particular orb wasn't no more than 30 feet from the ground. The last thing I want to mention is, last night when I seen the ones hoovering in my front yard that scared me. Later that night 3am ish I seen this bright bright white light coming through my curtains. I glanced out the crack and saw 2 orbs hoovering above my truck. It was so bright it lookws like the sun was shining. It was so crazy. I'm such a thrill seeker and get so excited seeing unexplained things such as these. Buy lately, it's getting to close for comfort and now I'm just genuinely freaked out bc I have no clue what this is. We've been seeing these more frequently. And my husband is dumbfounded with no explanation on what we are seeing. Before he would blow it off. But not now. We seem to always see orbs. Orange and the bright LED color. ! We have watched blinking red crafts that stay in one spot for long periods of time and take off. These blinking ones defy the odds of being a plane or drone. The movement has been incredibly fast and my neighbors has a video of a fleet. I've never seen anything like it in my life. I've reached out to my brothers who are in the military and they were amazed at what they seen to. I would welcome a team of investigators to stay on our farm for 1 week to document and explain to us what we are seeing. And I'm not sure if this means anything but when we've tried to film with our cell phones our batteries drain so fast or our phones shut off even if they are at 50% battery life. Maybe its the temperature changes maybe not. But this is the 2nd battery I've had to replace on my cell since spring of 2020."

My 16 yr old son came home around 1030pm and we started taking videos. We then found like 4 or 5 more all throughout the sky.they looked like flashing lights in the night sky.  We then took pics and videos because now they were turning into what looked like spheres and all different shapes.  One of the pictures we took actually shows the bottom of the object and it clearly shows a circle bottom and then it like disappears and shoots off the screen. I also took a video of all 3 in 1 video to show it wasn't just a fluke happening. It was actually something in the sky.

691,11/3/20 21:00,Chicago,IL,Egg,"While sitting outside last night, I witnessed a seemingly low-flying egg-like object move incredibly fast through the sky. The view from my 3rd story deck spans from northeast to southwest, and the object crossed the entirety of that view in a span of about a second and a half, similar to the speed you might witness in a shooting star. In trying to judge how high it was flying, I can compare against the backdrop of skyscrapers I see southeast from my location, and it appeared to be flying at perhaps the height of a helicopter (there was also a great deal of helicopter action in the sky last night due to the election).  I was also able to make out in that brief moment that it was an elongated, oval or egg-like shape, which also suggested it wasn't flying terribly high.  Additionally, I saw it pass in front of my view of several of the skyscrapers of downtown Chicago, which are between 1-2 miles south of me. The object itself was egg-shaped from the brief glimps! e I got, and it glowed. There were no distinguishable individual lights on it, and nothing blinking.  A very large tail of light followed behind it, perhaps due to speed. The light was bright, but not blinding. It moved in a gently arced, horizontal line, not straight across the sky.  There was no sound as it passed, which struck me as peculiar given its incredible speed and seemingly low-flying position. It traveled from east to southwest, disappearing from my view as it flew past the visual barrier I have of the exterior wall of my building that defines the end of my outdoor space. My husband and neighbor were also outside, but by the time I could shout out, the object was already gone.  I would be extremely curious to hear if anyone else had a similar sighting."

763,10/29/20 21:15,Breckenridge,TX,Light,"Driving south on Curry Pool rd after leaving a gas station at dusk, as we came to a stop sign at a T-intersection (Curry Pool rd and FM 2231 W), my wife and I noticed two horizontal red lights about a mile southwest of us and a couple thousand feet in altitude which I took to be unusual wingtip lights on a Cessna. As we were stopping at the intersection the two lights rotated clockwise until they were vertical. I was expecting to see a plane in a hard bank however the lights just winked out and there was nothing. Turning east onto  FM 2231 W, we were curious about the lights we had just witnessed and parked at the intersection of FM 2231 W and County Road 229 to watch the southern sky from a small hilltop. A few moments later a brilliant red light with a faint yellow tinge, round in shape, popped on a couple miles south at about the same altitude as the two lights seen a couple mile west. This intense red, singular light, sat stationary as another red light ! popped on to it's southwest another mile or so behind the first. Then a third popped on in the distant south maybe 5 or so miles back, difficult to estimate. In all there were about four separate lights. They were silent. They never made a formation, changing locations seemingly randomly. They would burn intensely for only a few seconds before winking out and popping on a mile or so away in an instant. Occasionally one of them would wink off but stay in it's place while flickering a very tiny faint white light before popping on again. This continued until they were hardly noticeable in the distance near to Cisco Texas. I was commenting on the unusual lack of air traffic over our area when we noticed the lights coming back our way. In three or four winks they had traveled back to FM 2231 W. All this taking place west of and parallel to Highway 183 S. We got our daughter (8 yo) out of the car to see as one popped on about a quarter mile south of us and 1000 to 1500 feet up. I! t was very bright. At this point all the lights went dark. A f! ew secon ds later two fighter jets tore behind us no more than 1000 feet up heading due east between FM 2231 W and Breckenridge city limits. These guys had no lights on. After the jets passed we saw nothing else. The precise date I am not sure. Either October 28th or 29th."

1017,10/13/20 21:00,La Loberia (Argentina),<br/>,Chevron,"Date: Tuesday, October 13, 2020 Time: 9:00pm Local Time Location: Just North of La Loberia, Coastal Village on Atlantic Ocean, Northern Patagonia, Argentina What was observed: My wife and I both saw a dark grey boomerang shaped aircraft flying due East over the beach toward the Atlantic Ocean and eventually disappearing into the horizon over the ocean. It was a clear, calm night about one hour after sunset and I was the first person to spot the craft directly over head (90 degrees above the horizon) and my wife was the second to see the object seconds later in front of us (about 45 degrees above the horizon) while we were walking due East on the beach toward the ocean. I saw the dark boomerang-shaped object for approximately 8 seconds and my wife saw it for about 4 seconds. The object was completely silent and was traveling at an extremely high rate of speed but did not appear to be accelerating. The object completely disappeared into the horizon very quickly and had two, very dim red lights on the bottom-side of what appeared to be the wing-tips or “ends” of the boomerang. It was difficult to assess the altitude of the vehicle,! but we both estimated it could have been between 250 to 500 meters above the ground. The size of the object was also very difficult to ascertain but it was quite large as the event happened so quickly. I don’t think many people really understand how difficult it really is to approximate altitude or size of objects when these events occur so quickly during the night like a flash in time and with no time to react to perhaps take a photo or video with our phones. I am not sure even if we had the wherewithal to snap a photo if it would have even registered due to the darkness of both the night and the object and the remarkable dim red lights of what might be described as a nearly dead battery powering these two points of light at both ends of the object. I am an engineer and a former surveyor and I have had previous training in distance, angles, measurements, and orienteering prior to the use of the most modern technology, but I still am having difficulty with the size, altitu! de and velocity of what we saw that night flying through the s! ky. What ever it was, we both thought it was not of this world. It is also worth mentioning that the night sky was completely clear and star-lit, with the milky-way starting to become visible toward the East over the Atlantic Ocean; however, there was still a small amount of light over the western horizon from the recent sunset. There was no moon or artificial light present during our sighting and we were truly amazed at what we saw together as this was the first type of observation of this nature for either of us. It is important to note that we live in a village where we see almost no commercial air traffic and due to the coronavirus pandemic almost all flights have been grounded in Argentina due to government restrictions. When we do see aircrafts, this may occur once per week (or sometimes once per month) and they are typically flying at cruising altitude maybe at 8000 meters (very, very high above sea level) and what we saw that night was nothing like a commercial aircraft with ! exhaust trails taking minutes to traverse the sky and only observable during daylight."

It was like they where hidden in plain sight. For someone to glance up, you can't see it. When I was pointing up to show my children the triangle patterns. DIRECTLY over our house one appeared and was a visible UFO. It was so close just above the roof and the trees. It was a different shape more round and moving south. It was so close to us and it was like it was creating its own light. There was no sound coming from it, and it was silent all around us. It was like everything was still. I panicked told my husband and saw it fly off in the dis! tance. Then I stayed outside starring up and see another rounded one appear below one of the triangular ones. I realized I was seeing flashes in the sky and hearing a metal noise also. The vibration in the atmosphere was like static. A very eerie and amazing experience. I come from the wright patt area and I am used to seeing some things but this was nothing like that and it was like it wanted to show itself to us."

As it was heading farther away from my view point and getting close to the constellation of the big dipper which was clearly visible on the horizon. A beam of light about the same color,  but not near as bright appeared to shoot up from ground level right next to the orb. The instant that happend both the orb and beam disappeared. Needless to say it was kinda hard to concentrate on fishing after that so I packed up and went home."

There was no sound coming from th his craft either. It appeared to be very close, maybe 100 feet above head."

I have been stargazing in this part of my yard for 5 years, and have never seen anything like this. It appeared to be a yellowish star-sized light that moved purposefully, yet V at a medium pace for approximately 2 minutes, then it seemed to flash slightly, and immediately turn 90 degrees toward the south. It looked like a smaller light remained at the point where the larger light made the 90 degree turn. It remained for about 10 seconds, and then slowly dimmed out. Meanwhile the primarily light continued in a southward direction in a straight line for at least another minute until I ! lost it in some trees.

As I began to pull over to get a better look and take my phone out, it completely vanished right before our eyes. My wife’s best explanation was a mylar balloon but at the distance and altitude and size, it would have been too big for a mylar balloon and she also couldn’t explain how it disappeared in an instant.

Vernon. I thought it was a helicopter but then as it came to be almost above my head, I realized it was not.  It was flat metal gray, almost black, it wouldn’t be easy to see had it not had lights on it.  It was triangular in shape but the points were flat, not pointed.  It spanned maybe 10 feet across and was 10 feet in length.  It had two bright lights on the front, like headlights , and a light on each wing, I guess, one was red and one was green.  Both blink opposite of the other.  It was traveling at I would say approx 20-30 mph.  It wasn’t fast.  I yelled for my friend Cody to come outside when it was directly over me.  It was very low, only about 6 feet above the tree outside my balcony.  And the sound it made was that if a very far away jet.  So oddly super quiet but very distinct. I saw no propellers, nothing move! d or it produced no wind at all and it stayed traveling at the same speed until it was out of site.  A car driving by stopped to watch it go by as well, so technically 3 witnesses but Cody came and saw it just as it was passing over head. Not sure what it was. But it was not a helicopter or a plane, at least not any that I know exist. If it was a drone, it was a huge effing drone.

At first I thought it was a helicopter or airplane but the longer I watched it I noticed no movement or green and red lights flashing.  So I started to record it and woke my husband up and as we watched it it just stayed in the same spot like it was hovering.  Then we thought maybe it was a really bright star.  So I turned my phone off and then saw the light slowly die out and then come back but this time it was higher up in the sky.  Eventually after recording it some more I though maybe I was being paranoid and it's just a star but when my husband went to work 2 hours later he drove in the same direction that we were initially looking at the object and when he got a couple miles up the road he was looking back at it.  I have a few videos of it just hovering.  Some are close to 20 mins long and you can see the light almost go away and come back but it seems to be in the same spot

He tried to debunk it, still didnt leave that area, we did notice it moved more side to side not up or down, always white then red light and soemtimes blue when it was flashing fast then the flikering or flash would slow down but always constant.Thought perhaps helicopter, they're super l! oud at night so we would have heard that.

It seemed to be following something because of the way it was flying. it would go to one spot, stand still for a minute, and then go to another spot. I noticed that it had to be following something flying in that way. I figured that it was chasing a car, but I happen to look up and across in the opposite direction of the helicopter. That is when I saw long cigar shape white or light-colored things flying in the sky. At first, I thought maybe it's Birds. then, I thought of drones but they had to have been huge because they were very high in the sky. They made no noiser. That is when they floated from one side of the Horizon across the sky the other side of the Horizon and just disappeared over the tops of the trees. I was watching while they were in a straight line at first. Then two went instead of one right in front of the other two, but perfect! ly  spaced, flew in front of the other two  but were offset exactly from the other two. Flying across the sky, they then started going one in front of the other in a diagonal line and they were in perfect format and perfectly in sync with each other. That is when I thought to myself ""I'm going to report this.""and That's when the helicopter followed them in the same direction. Then, It was over. I heard the helicopter for about 20 minutes longer, I did not see neither the UFOs or the Helicopter."

When they would move, they'd curve: like S turns, they would stop, then hold still, move straight down slowly, then straight back up, hold still, move at angles.  I had to leave, so I'm unsure how long it continued, but we watched it for at least 15 minutes.

Similar to a lawn mower or maybe a train but we don't live close to train station and it's too late at night to mow your lawn. My dogs were creeped out. Now so was I. Ran to get my husband he thought maybe it was a train too? But it didn't make sense.. He shrugged it off. I went upstairs with our dogs and looked outside our bedroom window at the stars and saw an orange light the size of the star. It was drifting gently to the right so I thought it could maybe be a plane in the sky but then it flew away. A plane would not dissapear into the night sky like that. I knew something was off. I ran back downstairs into our backyard and the sound was gone.

1564,9/6/20 22:00,Chelan,WA,Light,"I was viewing the night sky directly overhead using a pair of 7X35 standard binoculars. Within a few seconds of putting my eyes to the lenses I observed a small white dot about the size of the smaller stars that seemed to be traveling at a very high altitude.  Much higher than any aircraft. It was moving rapidly from the northeast to directly overhead.  My first thought was a satellite.  My second thought said it was traveling much too fast and deliberate to be a satellite.  As I continued to follow it, suddenly a second small white dot appeared, in my binoculars field of view, coming from the exact opposite horizon, the southwest, and was traveling at what appeared to be the exact same rate of speed as the other white dot . I then was remarkably able to view both white dots, traveling at the same rate of speed, directly opposing each other and on what appeared to be a collision course. I then had an odd thought that they were aware of each other and weirdly I fe! lt connected. Very strange feeling . They continued along a direct collision course and at the moment they reached each other they very quickly (literally in a moment) looped around each other in extremely close proximity as if they were playing and then each white dot preceded back in the opposite direction that it came from. I was able to watch both and as one disappeared from my binoculars field of view I continued to follow and watch the original one as far as I could until it disappeared over the Northeast horizon. This entire viewing only lasted between 30 and 45 seconds.  Amazing to me is out of all the stars present in this clear night sky during this event, these two small specs appeared crystal clear to me and as though they were communicating to me."

The white one appeared further away or smaller than the orange one.  They were within our line of site for less than a minute and moved at a steady pace.

There was a triangular shaped craft with a solid red light on each corner of the craft.  The craft looked to be solid and dark in color.  It was not large but not tiny either, I would say approximately the size of a room, maybe 12 feet in each direction.  It was hovering just to the North side of the highway and approximately 75 feet in the air.  There was no sound, it was silent. I was driving and was unable to get my phone out and take a picture, but it was dark enough outside that I don’t think a picture would have been clear anyway.  As for how long it was there, I am unsure.  I saw as I was driving down the road and it was still visible in my rearview mirror until I was out of the area.

It did not seem to be traveling fast, there was no engine sound as a place or helicopter would make.  It turned Easterly and slowed down almost to a standstill, then another one caught up to it about 30 seconds later and it continued traveling east and the 2nd one followed it.  Within a minute a 3rd one showed up from the same flight path and followed #2.  Then less than a minute the 4th one got in line and they all headed east.

I also noticed other much smaller lights occasionally shooting off the light or flashing around it. This starlike light also appeared to randomly shift at times.  Usually very small but erratic movements.  The light also appeared to be pulsating erratically.  My wife and I watched for almost an hour.  It slowly shifted north on the horizon over the course of an hour.  The part that has me convinced it is not a typical star is the size and intensity of the bright light and the strange light phenomenon shooting off and around this bright orb.

But then it remained stationary and would do slight hovering movements. I went back inside to watch it from my back window for a while to be very sure that it was moving and then I woke my husband.  We watched it remain still for a minute then it would drop a little and go back up and to the side.  These motions were very smooth almost like a flowing dance.  I watched it for over an hour and a half then chose to go to sleep. It had moved significantly across the sky from the original spot. It was able to do round motions.  At one point I saw an airplane cross the path of the object at a different altitude, thinking it might trigger some type of movement for the light obj! ect to leave but it did not, and it confirmed for us the difference between the movements of a plane and this object."

I knew that it wasn't a plane just by the look of it. I watched it for a while, then I got my boyfriend to verify what I was seeing and he thought it was very odd too. Then I got my phone out and started recording at first I was recording it and I could see it on my phone moving and then my phone just stopped recording and went to the home screen. I went to re-watch that and there's weird noises you can kind of see the light a little bit and then there's two different times there is these flashes of lights. And then I tried another time and got a 5-minute video. In the video you can see it moving side to side up and down criss-cross every direction very quickly, which I could not see with my naked eye. I went into the house to get b noculars I only watched it for about 1 minute with the binoculars and then it was gone. It had red green and a white/yellowish light and it was a diamond shape. I went out tonight and saw there again in the same spot. I ran in immediately after taking another 5-minute video and looking at it for not even a second and it started to leave. I went in the house to see it better binoculars and it took me awhile to find it again but I saw something with blinking lights that was very far away what I could not make out of shape but I did see red blinking and a white yellowish blinking. It made no sound or no sound that I could hear being so far away. But was moving very quickly and then it would hover and then move very quickly again and then hover.It was very far away I could tell because I could not see it with my naked eye. And then it got really bright and it was just gone. I've seen it two nights in a row in the same spot.

It mas moving slowly moving from NE to N direction.  A moment later of watching, three other similarly oriented objects appeared to be rising in a vertical line and moving from NE to N. I then urgently called my husband from inside the house to look.   There was no sound, they glowed for possibly a few minutes and then faded out completely. I took pictures of them.  While sky lanterns are illegal in Maryland.  While the neighbor, husband and I were both shocked at the observation, the neighbor does not believe they were UFOs, suspected that they were sky lanterns."

The disc was moving South and moving slower than the jets were.  The disc slowly gained altitude and distance from my view.  My friend confirmed this sighting and when he had his binoculars, the disc was going out of our view.  The disc was dark in color and the Sun was reflected from it or it was a bright light on the side of the disc.  The disc was viewable by us for at least 10 minutes because of the disc not moving fast. The jets did not return toward the disc while we watched.

Once I came to the realisation that it wasn't making any noise, I grabbed my phone and ran to the end of my driveway in hopes of getting a video.  I guess I was so startled by the fact that it changed direction almost instantly that I didn't hit record.

It made no noise and left no trail.  I'm going to guess it was about 2,000 feet up.  It moved past us and then we saw a ball of light and it was gone . I have been searching local sites since last night,in Hope's that someone else saw it as well."

The other going the opposite direction went on for a while longer then disappeared.  We watched outside in our back yard for another 20 minutes. Nothing.  Then we went to our front yard and went on to see 4 more lit objects all going in different directions spaced out about 5-7 minutes apart. 2 of them went a short distance before completely disappearing into thin air."

1971,8/17/20 21:00,North Myrtle Beach,SC,Unknown,"On Monday August 17th while stargazing for shooting stars between the hours of 10 and 11 pm, my friend Pam and I noticed something very unusual.  I live in the Windy hill section of North Myrtle beach SC and while sitting on the oceanfront balcony we observed a large orange light which then became two lights, then three, and ultimately four orange colored lights in the sky over the water.  The lights stayed there for a count of about seven seconds then went away.  Pam and I immediately thought UFO.  While we were discussing what it wasn’t, over the course of about 30 minutes it appeared three more times.  After the third time we observed what we thought were military aircraft searching the same area for a few minutes.  When the aircraft were no longer in the area the final observation of the orange lights appeared.  I am sending this information to NUFORCE so they can record the time and date of the incident.  I called Nufoce last night and the person I spok! e with said to fill out the form on the website.  My iPad is not allowing me to use the form so I am sending this email while the incident is fresh in my mind."

It obviously wasn't a star and it was far up in the sky maybe a few more miles above the atmosphere, it was heading north then disappeared.  Another one towards the West started moving and again disappeared.  At first I said it was a satellite but my husband said that they would not be going at such a pace as we were seeing them go by.  So I checked the satellite radar and it said there was only one in Adel ga but we live in quitman ga.  But it didnt stop there we saw three more lights flying across the sky all heading in different directions.  They werent comets or asteroids because if that were to be the case they would leave a faint quick trail when burning up in the atmosphere.  But the lights were just passing by no flickers or trail just moving before quickly vanishing.  Also mentioning the fact that the lights were moving! as if being directed towards certain directions and while this happened flashes of light occurred with no signs of clouds anywhere it was clear but the flashes came from the sky itself which we found strange."

Some appeared paired where others were single but all following in a line across the Northwestern sky.  Seemed to come out of darkness (clear night) and returned behind darkness.  The whole event lasted 15 - 20 seconds (estimate).  I was too puzzled by what I saw I wasn’t timing it.  Much too high to be planes.  Perhaps satellites but never seen so many moving together in a string.  No reasonable explanation yet.  Have not seen any news reports yet either about this.  First time I’ve EVER seen something like this and first time EVER reporting such a siting.  Felt compelled to tell someone about it.  Definitely not a dream.

As I sat and watched, something caught my attention off to the NW about 15 degrees above the horizon. It was a ball that looked similar to a star however larger. The object had several distinct lights on it, red, green, and white respectively. The lights flashed at irregular intervals as the object moved laterally left and right also irregularly. After about five minutes of trying to figure out what it was, the object shot straight up about 10 more degrees before moving right very abruptly and then shooting straight back down to its original position in the sky. I ran inside to alert my sister who came out and watched with me. For the next half hour or so, we watched the object move irregularly while trying to get the object focused in a telescope. Unfortunately the object was moving too irregularly to keep in frame and we had no more than three seconds at a time of view ! through the scope. It slowly began to fade away and we both thought that it was going to completely disappear however, it came back at a truly unbelievable speed to its original position where it stayed for another five minutes, moving hard left and hard right irregularly. Finally, the object seemed to go directly away from us very fast until completely out of view and this time it did not return.  We were both very very skeptical of any kind of alien or supernatural entities to say the least however, this experience has changed our minds considerably.  I am a Digital Forensics major going into my senior year. I have dealt with technology all my life and have always had an interest in the viewing of celestial events.

I would think this object was pretty big being that it looked large in the clouds and the clouds were at least several thousand feet in the air.  minutes later to the south of us I noticed 3 stars in the sky get blocked out by what looked like a stationary or slow moving cloud until the cloud dove straight down towards the ground and evaporated before my eyes and the stars that were blocked out were back. minutes after that that same cloud was over my house and moved to the west faster than a cloud moves and once again disappeared. shortly after this with in 3-5 minutes that cloud formation which was roughly the! size of a bus moved over my house quickly again and heading south and evaporated not before my daughter and I witnessed 5 or six glowing lights within the cloud.  until it disappeared over my neighbors house.

Upon sunrise or shortly after witnesses could see the aliens in a tree.  Witnesses shot several rounds at the aliens in the tree and one alien drooped out of the tree and fell down a steep embankment.  Witnesses were to freaked out to go down the embankment to see if there was a dead alien laying there.

2186,8/9/20 17:27,Norfolk,MA,Other,"I was in my pool, looking up and heard an airplane above. I looked and saw a small personal plane flying over head, to the left of the plane I saw an object that I initially thought was a hawk. I have chickens so I was wary of having hawks overhead so I watched it to see if it would come down from where it was. It was very high up in the air, it had what I could imagine was a wing span. I was waiting for it to circle the air the way hawks do and it didn't, it just hovered, then it moved slowly. I figured it was a hawk surfing the wind. But it still didn't behave like a hawk. So I thought maybe it was a vulture or an eagle. I came to the conclusion that it was a type of eagle or vulture. I kept staring at it, it must have been about 1 minute by this point. The airplaine was out of sight. Then all of a sudden, it changed direction and shape and what looked like a bird then looked like a dark ball or sphere/disc with a slight shine to the top of it and it seeme! d like it was rotating while it quickly descended downward at an angle of about 45 degrees with a purpose, no wavering it was a clean line,toward the direction where the plane was headed although the plane was not on a descent. the object had no wings at this point. I wondered if it was a drone? I looked up drones with retractable wings but couldn't really find any. I also looked up drones that look like birds and couldn't find a match. I know drones have lights, but this thing didnt have any. So strange."

The planet was at least 10 times the size of the sun and i doubt it it belonged to our solar system.  I have been looking for it since but it has been cloudy so i have had zero success.  I want to know what is going on with venus.  I want to know what that black planet is.  I see strange things in the sky on a regular basis.  I also have one thatappears on my canera like a plane but it turns and start getting brighter then it backs up and goes out the way it came in.  No plane does that.  Or helicopter."
2292,8/5/20 23:35,Sycamore,IL,Oval,"I was driving home from my sisters around 11:30pm at night Wednesday, Aug 5th 2020.  About a mile from home I noticed a bright object in the sky over the cornfields off to my right. It seemed strange to me immediately, and I pulled to the side of the road to look at it.  The object seemed to be made entirely of light.  It was so bright and twinkly, I couldn't clearly see the perimeter, but it was oblong/oval/tic tic-tac shaped, and at least 20 or more times larger than the a bright star or planet.  It appeared to be in our atmosphere, as it sat, unmoving in the sky.  Saturn was bright that night, and this object appeared in the sky near Saturn, so it was easy to have a frame of reference.  I watched for between one and two minutes.  The object never moved.  Not closer or further, not left or right. After watching for those couple minutes and being totally mystified, I got spooked and drove the remaining mile home.  When I got home.  I came out to look at Saturn.  No oval light in sight."

I was sitting in the passenger seat with my eyes to the sky when I saw a strange blue light flying east from over the Sierra Mountains. The object flew down from over the ridge and across the highway, approximately 200 feet above the ground. The object was small, much smaller than any aircraft I'm familiar with. It didn't have any blinking lights, visible wings or rotary blades- just a tealish orb of light. It flew over a large field to the east, and hovered. Two larger objects with white lights followed behind it, coming from the same direction over the mountains. These objects were larger than the blue orb, and seemed to travel at a faster speed.

I knew my gun scope was way more powerful so I removed it from rifle and now I can see the actual shape clearly.  Almost clear in the middle with a circle of lights all Around the perimeter.  I could see the spacing of the lights.  I have the scope to My wife. She confirmed what I was seeing.  Same as my two daughters.   There was some kind of structure in the middle. Like a arm going across.  We watched it go from the south to north with a eastern tilt.  As it got darker the lights changed color to amber.   Then it was apparently gone none of us saw it but it disappeared so we thought.  My wife used the scope and found it again.  It was just a lot smaller.  But still visible.  Then she said it was flashing lights.  I took the scope and confirmed a quarter of the circle was flashing in a pattern like a police officer car motioning traffic.  White light.

I noticed my neighbor was watching something in the sky for a moment longer than usual.  I looked up and saw that she was looking at something. It was a light, as high up as an airplane, not blinking or going at usual speed  (Color was not odd.. not red, blue, or green) (It was a yellow or white). It was a little larger than an airplane, but was going twice as fast. It was eye catching because it was not a satellite but lower on an airplane level... and going at an unusually faster speed.  It definitely was not a low airplane or a drone. My neighbor said, ""What is that?""  I said with authority, louder voice, and no fear, ""That is a UFO. The Great Deception .""  As soon as I said this, it slowed down to half or more speed and glowed up to 4x its size. My neighbor, daughter, and I felt that it saw us.  It actually felt like it took a picture of us from so far up."

I am a Marine corps veteran and my friend's dad is a US Army veteran  We arrived hours late around 2330 buds central standard time.  My friends dad who owns the camp is at this time sitting by the campfire.  We all unpack and set up tents or racks in the garage and settle in.  About a half hour into our usual formalities and during a lull in the conversation I ask my friends dad (who I consider a father to me) why he keeps looking at the sky.. he says ""oh it's nothing"" a little while later his son asks him the same question.  He then seems withdrawn. And points to the sky where I look.  I was on the same side of the campfire as him.  I noticed a weird constellation a perfect equalalateal triangle the three points were the brightest points in the sky.  I asked if this was what he had see  be said yes but that's not! the weird part.  Seconds later the triangle seemed to shed a orb or ball shaped craft that stayed all g the edge of the craft for a few minutes then wormed it's way across the sky slowly and inconsistently before stopping for a minute the darting across the sky at great speed. They also appeared out of nowhere or shot across the sky then j hooked back the way they came.The rest of the night was extremely event full we say two distinct formations of craft s Chase each other across the sky. Lesser flashes of light near the craft as if possible explosions from a distance. Also what appeared to be light beams emitted towards each other.

Towards the direction of Mirror lake Utah, about 9am we saw a tiny white dot in the sky.  It appeared much higher than the flight of any jets.  15x binoculars showed a concave bottom disk Shaped object.  At first I thought maybe something like a NASA parachute or a weather balloon but after watching it for a half hr or so it was still in the area.  It was miles high and distant to us but it was white and definitely had a concave (in the center 50%) base.  We eventually went back to packing up camp and left.

We saw some divide from one light into three, hover and fly off.  At one point two crossed paths hovered and continued in different directions, most of the sightings occurred crossing past the Milky Way or that general viewpoint.  From our vantage point it seemed like they were the same size as the stars and very far above us and would cross the entire skyline moving in fast jerky movements, stopping and or shooting off at a fast pace.  We managed to capture one on a cell phone, all you can see is a tiny dot moving across the screen and even though there was a full sky of stars the phone camera only shows the light which we though was strange even at the time.  Here’s the video we got of a smaller one, we are convinced they were not bugs or satellites. Would love to know if anyone else saw anything that weekend.  We enjoyed all the moments and it will remain a magical memory for all of us."

I assumed it was a plane because it was coming from the direction of Philadelphia International Airport. It made no sound so I assumed it was flying high but it seemed to be moving too fast if it was in high altitude. Then it seemed to stop and fade in brightness as it got smaller and smaller till it disappeared. I immediately thought I must be looking at a rocket heading out into space but that made no sense. The whole thing happened in a span of about ten seconds. I’m an amateur astronomer and quite familiar with the night sky and the planes that cross my region. This wasn’t a plane. It was a round bright object appearing slightly larger than Jupiter in the night sky. What struck me was how fast it all happened. I was thinking, “That’s funny, a plane coming from Philly and already that high in the sky?”  Then it s! tops and heads out to o space? Weird. Did I see a UFO?"

2710,7/15/20 20:03,Mayfield,NY,Circle,"My wife, mother in law, and two friends were on my pontoon boat on the Great Sacandaga Lake in Mayfield, New York.  It was 20:00 on 7/15/20 and we were anchored just off Beacon island on the south end of the lake.  My mother in law said, “What is that in the sky?”  Just seconds after discussion of the comet that was supposed to be visible that night.  We all looked up and saw a white cylindrical object high in the sky.  I am a private pilot and I would estimate the object to be around 20,000ft to 30,000ft or possibly even higher in the sky.  It appeared to be above the cirrus clouds. The sky was blue except for a few clouds.  The object did not move at all and stayed in the same exact spot for about thirty minutes.  It was eventually obstructed by cirrus clouds as they moved under the object.  We attempted to take photos of the object but none of the photos came out clear enough.  I wondered if it was a star or planet, however the sun was not set yet and there! were no other objects or stars anywhere else in the sky.  This object looked very much out of place.  I questioned if it was a weather balloon but like I stated above, the object never moved from this spot.  It never appeared larger or smaller as if it was ascending or descending.  It stayed completely still and the size did not appear to change.  It was white in color, assuming it was reflecting sunlight and we were unable to properly identify the color.  Several hours later, my friend sent me a screenshot of the object that someone took in Johnstown, NY. About 15 minutes south of our position.  This picture was much more clear than our blurry photos and the object looked more like and unidentified flying object.  Not just a weather balloon.  This object did not make any noise.  All photos will be sent via email. The photos took from my boat were taken at 20:03.  I do not have a time the photos were taken from Johnstown, however is was roughly the same timeframe."

It lasted way longer than any shooting star and the top of the thing was long and slender and burning so bright it looked almost blue with a reddish tail.  So magnificent! Immediately after that there were several (at least 6) craft of some kind that looked exactly like stars and had been stationary up to that point that in unison, from different places that scattered away from that area.  There are always these lights in the sky that have a steady light, nothing blinking and with no sound, that look exactly like stars, same size, same color, everything, but last night it's like they all wanted to get away from whatever had just happened.  Something appeared to fall off the shooting, glowing object, it seemed like some kind of malfunction instead of a shooting star.  From nowhere I see an airplane leaving the area as well.  I've never witnessed anything like that and I'm always looking at the sky. After that, the sky was so alive, there were those lil things moving all about and blinking lights, twinkling stars, just so much movement.  My dog was barking like crazy, the way he does when someone strange comes around.  I'd love to know what was going on. I'm so glad I was able to witness it with someone else! Wow!"

We watched the light  Approximately 6 minutes then it started moving to the northeast. it was very low to the ground moving very slow there was no noise whatsoever. the only noise was the noise of my pool as we were in the pool swimming when we witnessed the UFO. anyway as the aircraft started moving to the northeast it started changing shapes by the time it got in front of our house it had turned from a white ball and two a aircraft type vehicle. it was not a plane b! ut it wasn't a flying saucer shape it looked like a giant white ball of light with two other boss of light attached to it.  The total sighting was maybe 10 minutes and once it took off to the North East it was traveling very slow but it just blinked out and disappeared.  One thing to note, I am ex-military a trained observer I’m currently a security guard at a shipyard I know aircraft and this was not anything I have ever seen before. This craft was never more than 150 yards away and as it went from East to Northeast it got closer and it was maybe 200 feet off the ground, at that range you would hear something and it was dead silent ! I’ve never seen anything like it before in my life and I have witnessed other UFOs .I’ve seen giant triangles , I’ve seen orbs,  I’ve seen the orange fireballs that just set and then take off mmovig, but this was completely different and I’ve got it all on video."

I looked at the object through binoculars and it was too bright too see anything other buit the most brilliant white light I’ve ever seen.  It appeared to slow down as if it was aware I was looking at it.  I felt a slight wave of anxiousness, and then it seemed to pick up speed again and kept traveling in a north eastern direction.  I then, went back inside of my house for about 5 minutes and when I came back outside it was gone, as if it had never been there.  I don’t believe this was a plane as there were no blinking lights and the rapid rate of travel."

2799,7/11/20 22:45,Irwin,PA,Circle,"At about 10:40 PM on July 11th, 2020 I took my dog outside in our back yard to use the bathroom.  It was quiet for about the first 15 seconds of being outside.  Next, my dog and I heard not one but multiple dogs barking and running down our street.  I didn't hear any reports from neighbors or on our local Facebook lost animals page about lost  dogs in our area either.  I volunteer for a local non-profit dog rescue and tend to get involved when people are looking for their lost pets.  I decided to investigate the situation.  I took my dog inside, grabbed my shoes and a flashlight.  I walked out the back door in our back yard and proceeded to the front of the house.  I could hear the dogs barking around me but couldn't see them. I stood out front on the street puzzled for about a minute . I walked about 20 or 30 feet up the street which was to the northwest.  I paused and looked across the horizon in the sky toward the northwest.  I immediately noticed a fairly large cir! cle object that appeared to be lifting from a location about a one mile away from where I was standing.  The object was glowing red, not that bright but bright enough to see the outline of the object.  I watched it move to the east and then south east toward my direction at a steady speed but at the same attitude.  It approached my street and I could see that the glowing red light was pulsing and the object looked semi-transparent.  It was completely silent as it flew as well.  As it was about to past over me, I heard the dogs from earlier barking and running throughout the neighborhood once again.  Even though I was about 40 feet from my house, I could hear my two dogs barking as well.  It freaked me out that I stopped looking at the object in the sky, and started to scan the area on the ground for the dogs running in the neighborhood.  A few seconds later, all the dogs stopped barking.  It was complete silence.  I took my eyes off the object for about 5 seconds.  I looked up in the ! sky again and saw that the object was now right above me but w! as at an higher attitude now.  It traveled between my property and my neighbors property going east.  I ran to the back of the yard to see if I could see it better but the treeline was blocking my view of the object."

Then as soon as the appeared, they just vanished against the black sky.  I kept looking up and I'm glad I did as this time there were three lights to appear flying in a triangle formation.  Travelling very slowly they were glowing white whit a hint of red towards the end of the orb shape.  They did this for about 7 seconds before simply vanishing."

So I did just such the first thing I noticed is how bright the moon was.  Then to the left I noticed a bright orangish looking star so I opened a starwalker app on my phone to see what star it was, which came to Mars.  While holding my phone to the sky matching the position of Mars on my phone to the orange star I notice a even brighter object just peaking about my neighbors tree so I pan left to see which star it was.  The only on that was close to the position I was pointing is a star named Menkar but this object was way to bright and slowly rising about the tree.  Within a few seconds it was a few inches about the tree yet the other stars around it didn't move.  Once it got to a certain height it stopped and look to pulsate then stopped.  After about 5-10 mins I went back in the house."

The lights appeared to be circling each other then would break into multiple smaller colored orbs.  It appeared to shine a light into the woods on the south west side of the lake and then down in the water.  It was silent.  It appeared to go in and out of the water but didnt cause a ripple.  I walked down by the lake to be sure it wasn't a drone or something.  It came towards me and stopped half way to me and appeared to become agitated.  It began heading north across the lake very quickly.  I lost sight of it and headed back up to the campsite.  In the sky we then saw countless crafts in the sky mainly gravitating towards one very large orange light that was darting around in the southern sky in the same general area.  There was another larger craft in the northern sky that was a completely different shape that was! also moving erratically in the same area.  This when to nor an hour or so and around 3:30 the began moving farther away and the lights slowly faded out.  Our dog was freaking out and acting like we've never seen.  It was completely silent the whole time.  The water developed a weird ripple to the east of the water event with a heavy fog.

2915,7/4/20 23:17,Burlington,VT,Formation,It was at 11:17pm when my wife and went for a ride and we were traveling south on I89.  We seen three really bright lights brighter than the full moon and brightest star in the sky flying in formation.  We then noticed that three flying in formation we being followed by many more bright lights to many to count.  However the very front light in the formation shot behind our in the north direction and another took its place in front.  But then the sky got so bright behind us it look as is the sun popped out.  But then that light that disappeared behind was back in front of us and it bright so we pulled over to try and see what it was and it stopped suddenly and meanwhile the formation of lights and its tail of lights were farther in the distance.  Both of us looked in aww and we realized the bright light we were looking at was a craft in the sky and was oval in shape and looked like a giant apartment building hovering in the sky and had other bright lights up the si! de that we could see in different spot throughout the side.  And as we sat on the side of I89 with our hazard lights blinking it seemed like we had been watching for an hour or longer not one vehicle went by on the N or S lanes we noticed that it still hovering above us but it looked like it was farther than it had been.  And all of sudden a bright bright light illuminated the complete bottom side of this craft it shot straight up to the point the bright light on the botton of the craft was a little bigger and brighter than the brightest star in the sky and then moved so fast in the eastern direction it was just flash of light.  When it was all finished it was 27 minutes long but it seem like it was two hours.  The two of us were physically drained and.  I was driving i was so drained that i was falling asleep driving and my wife was asleep five minutes after it disappeared.  We see planes all the time and we see different types of helicopter because we live close to the flight path of a runway at Burlington International Airport and helico! pters fly over on their way to the hospital and the both are very noisy.  This craft was not making any noise and definitely didn't move like any aircraft i know of.  I truly believe we seen ufo's on America's Independence Day

I had just come from the back yard watching the fireworks show put on by our local village. Due to the restrictions in place by COVID 19 we were not allowed to attend the fireworks at that time.  After the show the neighbors continued to set of their own displays, so I proceed to go out front to my driveway to watch. At 10:44pm I saw an orange sphere approaching from the NNE at a slow speed, too high and silent to be a drone I reached for my iPhone and began to video the object. It was headed south in the direction at which I was standing then proceeded to pause and dim then reappearing several times.

It was apparently watching the same fireworks to our north, then it moved Eastward low on the horizon.  I was looking for an airplane type of red and green light but it was definitely not conventional, unless it was a drone pretending to be an UFO.  Distance is hard to tell but I live about 5 miles South of the city, so even with the distraction of fireworks, it still should have been seen by many people.  Thanks for filling this report.

I came out from behind the cloud and I was videoing it or trying to.  I followed it, it started to move away as soon as I started recording it.  I followed it for several yards I think.

2977,7/3/20 23:00,Casper,WY,Diamond,"On July 3 2020 a friend and I were drivin g to labonte canyon by Douglas Wyoming. At 11 pm we stopped for a second.  I looked up at the sky and seen something in the sky.  It was red and blue.  I pointed it out to my friend and we both thought it may have been a drone. We continued driving and noticed it was following us.  A few minutes later another appeared off to the right of us.  At that point I turned the truck around and sped down the road.  More and more of them began appearing around us. I turned down a back road that I know goes through some dense trees.  Before we got to that area we seen one to our right drop to about 6 feet above the ground it was a diamond shape and it began changing colors fast like a hologram.  When it got that close it looked like it could only be about 6 feet from point to point.  We came to a t in the road and at that time another one dropped right above the ground on our left and did the color changing thing.  We watched it for a fe! w seconds and seen 2 human shaped objects walk out to it from behind a bush.  I got scared and quickly started turning to the right.   While I was starting to turn a bright red light shine through the windshield from infront of us.  There from where that light was coming was another human shape. I drove even faster.  The road lead us to a heavy forested area where I thought we could lose them but as soon as the road went into the trees 2 of the objects moved over the road and continued to follow us.  The road lead us into glenrock where we continued into casper.  We parked at the cmon inn hotel where we were staying.  When we got there we both stayed in the truck and watched them.  They had pit some distance between us when we were in town but they were just sitting there flashing. We watched them for maybe an hour and a half then I wanted to see if they were going to keep following us.  I jumped on the interstate and went east. They followed us from a distance.  I got off the interst! ate at the hat six ramp and headed south down hat six road. They continued to follow us.  The sun was beginning to rise when I turned onto Smith creek road.  At this point there was one in front of us less than a mile away, one behind us less than a mile away and the other were on either side of us high enough to where we could barely see them.  It was a little cloudy out.  The one behind us would move to where it was maybe 50 yards from us and then move back into the cloud.  It did this repeatedly.   As the sun got higher the 2 that were in front and behind us stopped changing colors and shined a bright white light.  Before I was able to get down the road and into the mountain they all moved into the clouds and disappeared."
2978,7/3/20 22:30,Pikeville,TN,Light,"Every night since May, except when its raining, a bright small light comes down from the sky and visits me.  No matter how high in the sky it is, if I peek out my window, it sees me and comes down to see me as if it’s as curious about me as I am it.  If it rains, it does not come down.  It stays in the sky until dawn then disappears into the clouds.  The closest it’s gotten is about 25 yds.  I do not have a fancy camera so the films I’ve made in the dark from my phone is all I have.  It looks like a starfish but it glows.  There is something that follows along side of it and it doesn’t glow but moves with it.  When it moves it shoots out white light across the treetops and sky, it reminds me of heat lighting.  My husband has seen it many times and at first thought it must be a drone but now he’s not sure what it is.  One night I was lying in bed and it came so close that my hair was standing up on my crown.  My dog senses when it gets too close and starts growling.  When I tell people about it, they just laugh at me so I haven’t had anyone come see for themselves except my husband.  He has seen it but he is afraid it’s a drone.  This is not a drone, it makes no noise."

We like to go on walks at night out there and never had any problems other than raccoons pestering us.  So about 2 weeks ago we get to this really dark part of the trails that's kind of deeper in the woods.  And we heard something very large falling like it's going to land on our heads.  I yanked her out of the way and look back and see something almost hit the ground but don't.  I don't know how else to explain it but then it was gone.  I chalked it up as Shadows playing tricks on me or something.  She thought it was weird and she doesn't believe in anything paranormal, UFO, or spiritual related.  Then a few days after that we are walking again and something very similar happens you can hear something dripping through the trees kind of violently.  Every time we just kind of brush it off but we're really freaked out.  So then just a few days ago we go ou! t walking again and get to the same exact spot on the trail.  And we look up and there is something about 4 ft tall standing maybe 30 feet in front of us. At first I thought it might have possibly been a deer but she seen it too.  I told her to give me her flashlight really fast.  She gave it to me I shined up it was no deer.  Before I could even get a flashlight on it this thing was ripping through the woods at a very fast pace.  I don't know who to call.  The police would all think I'm a crazy person and I don't want to jeopardize my family.  Unless there is a methed out naked midget in the woods throwing stuff and stalking us I don't know what else to say.  We are really freaked out. We have encountered something in the same spot three different times.  This location is the Deep spot of the Woods at Lake Storey on the far end like you were heading out towards the country.  I know whoever is reading this probably thinks I'm a nut and I would too.  I've talked to a few people and one person told me to call you all."

We slowed down the car to get a better look when suddenly it began to rotate and we could see it was a huge triangular object.  A white light on each corner and a red light in the middle.

The first time it happened, I told a couple of people what I saw and they said there was a lantern ceremony nearby, so even though I was skeptical because the lights I saw were way to high to be lanterns, I accepted it.  Last night what I saw was approx. 30 flying objects flying in a perfect line, in perfect synchronicity. They were so far, I really couldn’t make out a shape.  It looked like a bunch of moving stars.  As each one would pass over another would follow behind it at the exact same distance in between each moving object, the exact same speed, and the exact same path.  The really crazy part is how perfect they were aligning with the one after/before.  Weird thing is I watched it so calm, and thought to myself, there is absolutely no logical answer someone can give me a to how perfect these things are moving together. Sidenote: I don’t drink, or take any drugs whatsoever, I’m not a UF! O conspiracy theorist. Today I’m actually super busy, but I had to take the time to post this somewhere.  Last side note; when I scrolled down as I was posting this, there was a box to check if “missed time was experienced”.

It jumped up and down as it tracks across the sky before disappearing.  Dad and three daughters witness this.  Dad was playing with a glow in the dark boomerang with a flashing red-blue led affixed on it before noticing this object in the sky that was originally thought as a plane or satellite.  But realized that it was moving too fast to be one. One daughter had noticed it was able to record it partially on phone and observed that it changed from white color to red prior it vanishing.

It looked like a huge drone but I dont remember seeing any propellers or means of propulsion. The object was somewhere around 200 ft or even a little more form me. But not far enough away that I couldn't see details. As soon as my tanker truck was nearly parallel with object it began to move in a southerly to eastward movement gaining altitude to clear trees at end of field. This is when it really was weird , because its shape somehow changed to a plane looking object that now was white with brown on it but the fuselage was too small for a conventional glider or plane. I never heard any noise,though my window was up. Did not get any pics. I was driving and have seen a lot if w! eird stuff and didnt take any pics. I felt I should report this.

As it appeared I thought in my head what the heck?, and I was sort of mesmerized by it, I thought it's too low to be a satellite , it has no wings, it had lights that blinked left to right , white, blue, red possibly green then white again .. The blinking stopped then started again at the left , at that time I realised the lights were blinking around the back of it.  The sun was reflecting off the top and made it look white then the row of rectangle lights , then the under side was a slightly dark grey colour .  I seen it heading towards another white cloud and at that time I finally snapped out of being mesmerized and ran into my apartment to grab binoculars only to get back out just before it disappeared behind a greyish colour cloud with a ! poody smaller white cloud .  The grey cloud was barely visible I expected the white cloud to be where I couldn't see it but it started to fade out with the grey cloud .  Fir the next couple days I was repeatedly going outside hoping to see it again .  I mentioned it to a couple people who didn't seem interested and I didn't say nothing but now I'm kind of freaked out about it.  Mainly because I did seem mesmerized by it.  It looked like any typical flying saucer , it was moving slow and it didn't look huge to me or no higher then a small sight seeing airplane would fly. Anyways I don't want to see it again !  Wild guessing I'm gonna say it was approx 30ft from one end to the other ? Also it made no sound at all or left any exhaust , ((name deleted))"

It traveled in a clockwise movement, when I went to get my binoculars to get a better view it was no longer in my view.  It shook me to my core and I watch satellites and space station fly by every day, this was not that. Maybe a drone but how far it went to the sky and the distance just seems unimaginable."

When I went to go check again at about 2300 all 4 were gone.  The most active one as described, seemed to be doing something and the other 3 UFO were not as active as far as moving.  They were positioned by twos, at an angle from each other. Imagine just the box portion of the Big Dipper, but in a diamond shape.  They had to be miles apart but seemed as if maybe the stationary ones were monitoring the active one.

3573,5/18/20 21:45,Portland,OR,Circle,my house is approximately 1/4 mile from pdx(Portland airport) i am to the south of eastbound approach and can see aircraft taking off and landing. Last night at around 8:45 pm I was on my back porch talking to a family member on the phone when I noticed a  right circular light just above the pdx east bound approach about 500 feet off the ground and if air traffic where coming into pdx this object would of interfered with landing trajectory.  The object moved sporadically in different directions for just over a half hour and the light would go brighter at times and the color would change from bright white to bluish. At first I thought maybe a drone but I myself am a drone pilot and quickly realized it was not a drone because I can't even launch my drone anywhere near the airport because of strict FAA regulations with all drones being GPS enabled when i do try to launch my drone it won't go more then 3 feet off the ground with warnings and alarms going off. I ! have a very clear two minute video of the sighting.

3593,5/17/20 15:05,Fort Worth,TX,Unknown,"I was standing outside at around 15:05 this afternoon when I noticed several small objects traveling due South at what appeared to be very high altitude. there were at least 7 or 8 of them in a very loose group. they were either producing green reflections, or were lit with a brilliant green color. At times some were visible, at other times they would disappear, and other noes would become visible. the weather was mostly clear and I was able to get a few photos, although none are very clear. I have worked on aircraft most of my life and these did not appear to be conventional planes. Planes flying together normally fly in some sort of formation rather than a loose random group. There was no order to their group. They continued flying South at what appeared to be a cruise speed, not in any hurry, until I lost sight of them."

It was going too fast and a straight to be a buzzard.  There was a 737 flying above it at about 5000 ft.  It was a clear day and no clouds.  It was shaped like the object from the U.S. Navy video ,not the the tictac object.  It was not a buzzard because they never fly in a straight line.  The 737 was flying much faster that the object.

No reflections of any kind seen, the white lights were quite brilliant but didn't reflect off the craft itself or light up the ground. Craft appeared very smooth with no detail or markings seen. The black color is hard to describe, it was VERY black. Observed for about 5 minutes. I've seen military aircraft in similar shapes, and there is a small airport a few miles east of me. This was not a typical aircraft, there were no typical red green running lights, no strobe lights, and no engine sound. I am a retired ! police officer, trained to observe.

Moving very fast we were freaking out because planes don’t fly in formation or in a group it was completely insane to witness something as wild as that. But the crazy part was at least to us was how clouds just came out and it was dark outside but in the direction they were flying was light like not super bright but enough where you can see the white clouds.

It looked like a dim star moving a at a constant speed.  We saw 10 to 12 more lights appear and fade away along the same path in the sky one right after the other in a straight line. At one point I saw four lights and as the top most light faded away a new one would appear. So I would put these lights starting north of Venus and higher in the sky then moving diagonally upward and to the south, then fading close to the top stars of the Gemini constellation. I know they weren’t planes, again way to high up and no strobes. I thought it was a satillite but then there were so many one right after the other. Anyway this is what I saw."

After 20 to 30 we of course intrigued looked toward the moon and see several doing their own thing.  Almost playing?  Darting close.  There was no sound.  Then it was over about 2 hours later.  For the ones that broke from formation.  The ones that headed towards the moon seemed to vanish?  I can't explain it other than what looked like tiny dimmer stars.

It was bright enough to think it was a plane with its headlights on coming straight at us (probably even much brighter), only it was one large orange light, not a white pair of lights.  At arm’s length, it was about the size of a pencil eraser.  At first we thought it was very low, as it was moving very quickly in a straight line that went almost directly over us.
