Tilted at about a 45 degree angle both poles of the object one pointed at sky other at the ground and was moving directly away from us opposite of the way it appeared to be pointed.  Was moving oddly fast when we first noticed it moving away from us overhead like following the highway and then it increased speed rapidly and shot off and disappeared in a second.  I followed it with my eyes or at least tried to it literally shot off and got tiny really fast showing distance and disappeared ahead in a smooth but sudden and lightning fast acceleration and was gone.  Clear blue open sky sunny out at the time we saw it.  Girlfriend and I both saw it.
35,12/28/17 23:30,Brownsville,PA,Disk,Glowing disk crafts in night sky
36,12/28/17 23:00,Eagle,CO,Fireball,"I live in Eagle, CO. 12 miles East of Eagle-Vail airport. Eagle, CO. is 6600 ft above sea level. My living room faces N.E. and is on the 10th fairway of the Eagle Ranch golf-course.  I was sitting at a couch having a cup of tea about 10:40 pm.  All the lights in the room were out as it was a fairly clear night, yet with only a few stars in view. The couch where I was sitting faces N.E. (I have three fairly large windows) where the night sky is easily viewed. In that the airport is 12 miles West--there are times when airplanes can be seen preparing for landing. I do not know the 'exact' above ground landing preparation distance (ground to air height) as a plane would fly over the golf course coming in for a landing, but I can guesstimate it to be only a few hundred feet or so. In other words when planes come in from the East or the N.E. preparing for landing they can be easily noticed. I mention this because what I am about to describe 'came in' from the N.W. at approximately the same height / distance that an airplane readying for landing would be above the ground. As I was looking out the windows I had a clear view of a wide-sky and the top of the mountain peaks. The orange fire-ball appeared to arrive as if it were entering the atmosphere. It was quick-abrupt; in the sense that what is depicted in a Star Wars film (just viewed the latest: The Last Jedi)-where crafts would go to hyper speed and then abruptly hyper-drive and then appear at their tended location. The orange-fire-ball came into my view from the N.W. exactly like that. When it appeared before my eyes however, it didn't stop abruptly and stay, but stopped for a nano-second and then very slowly continued to travel a very short distance. During this time the fire/flame surrounding the object evaporated and the orange ball proceeded on a S.E. direction then made a very slight turn more eastward--the orange object then lost its complete 'orange color' as it glided towar! d the S.E. where a very small red light was noticed at the tai! l end an d just enough of a very faint outline of an indistinguishable total form would be difficult to describe. Yet, I could see a non-round/ball object in that it was definitely no longer a 'ball'. That's the only way I can describe it. However, it did appear to have more of a 'widened-non-ball' type of shape as it awesomely 'glided' toward the southeast and vanished--taking no longer than about 60 seconds or so as the small red light that seemed, when first noticed, to be at the tail of the object couldn't be seen anymore. It was awesome as it glided into the distance with a steady faster than an airplane's speed would be noticed when coming in from the E. or N.E. to land at the Eagle airport. The reason I saw some distinguishable area of the form was that as I was viewing it from behind there was a very thin yellow-white light that appeared to be a outline of the underbelly of a type of 'wing'? that gave me a reference point to watch it smoothly glide away! This is all I can rea! lly describe. The 'glide' was a kind of smooooooth straight and then light bounce type of motion that then just kept its path. It was very real. The reason I waited until this day (Jan. 7 2018) to post the siting is that I have the 'flu' for just over a week. Therefore, having enough time to recollect what I viewed."

The color was white, and it looked like it was giving off what, I can best describe, as electricity.  When I first saw this object, I thought it was a drone, but it made no noise and, since it was a bit windy, it's movements were too smooth for it to have been a drone.  I woke up my husband to have him see what I was seeing - he is very logical and would tell me what he thought it was.  But, when he saw it, even he was astonished and unsure what it was. I stayed up all morning watching it, and as the sun was coming up, it stopped moving, almost like it was pretending to be a star."

There was no color change just dimming and brightening.  As each one passed they followed the same direction and made a slight angular turn of about 20 degrees to the south of my location.  Each one was slightly closer as they passed over and I could see details of the third one.  It appeared as if there was an orangeish haze coming off it but not enough to leave a trail.  There was a smaller sphere inside of the large outer one and was positioned at about 7:00 area in the direction it was traveling.  The smaller one illuminated the outer one.  There was no structure to it, it looked like a giant bubble.  There was absolutely no sound.  The only odd effect was static electricity feeling in the air.  The objects grouped to gather in a diamond shape and ascended into the clouds and that was the end of the sighting.  I have an hd video that is about 6 minutes.

I just figured the moon was unusually bright tonight.  Less than 2 minutes later I am on Reseda Blvd and this giant pure bright white light is coming closer and closer following the path of the boulevard.  The light was brighter than anything I've seen, I first thought it could be a plane or maybe a helicopter using a sheriff spotlight but as I drove forward and it approached it became clear this was too bright to be any sort of familiar craft.  It looked like it was moving slowly, but once I was under it and saw the brightness and size of the craft, it had to be moving at an incredible speed, also considering I had seen it near the mountain range which is over 45 minutes away and in a minute it is now above me.  I slowed down trying to reach for my phone and soon I wa! s underneath it.  Two other cars were pulled over and were outside their cars looking up at whatever this thing was.  As i was now directlynunder it Iooked up and it was a triangular shaped craft made of this strange black material that camouflaged well with the night sky. The bright light was not visible from this angle which was also odd, no light was visibly emitted from my point of view beneath it.  It had a small light on two points of the triangle.  It looked like the bnody if the craft was made of panels of that unique black material.  I stopped dead in the street (it was almost 3 am) and stared up at it thru my windshield.  It seemed to know I was looking up because it just hovered over me and I began to drive off because i know had the chills.  I looked in my rear view mirror and it was no where to be seen.  The craft was silent but seemed to be observing me and its surroundings"

About 50 to 100 feet above the water, three neon green lights turned on and shot down to the water faster than anything I've ever seen move in my life.  Honestly it scared the crap out of me.  I thought an explosion was coming. I even remember bracing for impact.  Instead of any kind of explosion (or a splash which I wouldn't be able to see because the river was dark at the time) the three neon green lights that formed a perfect triangle quickly faded out.

One standing above me into that appeared to be monitoring a wall that look like it was full of different small screens or something.  It was difficult to get any detail because the moment I open my eyes and caught a glimpse I felt thrown back and then I was back laying in my bed and I could not move.  I tried to call out to my girlfriend laying next to me but all I can make was a small noise and my eyes closed and I was back asleep again.  My girlfriend recalls hearing me make a noise that night.  The following day she showed me an article showing unidentified flying objects over Lexington County.  The article describe this as about a half dozen Jets but there were no crafts that were supposed to be flying at the time according to the reports.

The lights were not blinking and they  look to be about maybe 30 feet between each other, Really to close . we were real close to 70 hwy 4 lane and the lights were close enough that we should have hear some noise if the were planes or jets but the hwy was busy so if there had been any noise from the air crafts the big trucks and cars  may have drowned it out. I asked my husband did he see those lights crossing the night sky ,he said he thought they were three small planes  but he was busy unloading the car off the roll back he had not really looked at the lights till they were further away from us ,I told him planes don't fly in a straight line and that close to each other without moving some ,these lights did not move like small planes would ,he th! en said its Jets , but the lights were moving across the sky really slow and low and Jets move fast cause we have seen Jets flying at night and their lights blink,the lights were moving from North to South ,there is a  airport for small planes and lear jets in Smithfield NC on business 70hwy ,but these lights were further down from where the airport is moving toward Raleigh.Not sure if they were planes or not but can't rule that out.just strange the way they were flying so low and with no blinking lights."

I was driving, my mother was in the passenger seat and my dog was in the back seat of my Prius.  It was a beautiful day; clear skies and mid-60s.  I was driving east on Hwy 55 when all of sudden my attention was drawn to the sky to an unidentified flying object heading east.  I could not take my eyes off of it and kept asking my mom if she could see it.  I kept repeating that it has to be a UFO.  It was not very obvious in the sky.  It appeared disc to round shaped and appeared to be moving very fast eastward.  Every few seconds I could see the right side of the craft like it was maybe tilting some and could appreciate a metallic/silver color – it wasn’t consistent.  My mother finally saw the object before I had to turn and agreed it was unusual and remarked it must’ve been a drone.  I was quite astonished by it and if it was a drone I’m impressed how quickly they move (almost like gliding across the sky).  I’d never seen anything like it.  Just thought I should report it in case anybody else makes a similar report.   This is a quick report as I am busy today.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions."

As I said before we are by an airport and saw at least 4 planes within a half hour take off from airport and could see any which direction the flew on that clear night and coul follow the planes blinking red and green lights for a long period of time.

Another series of lights followed in a similar direction about 15 seconds later, but were a lot dimmer, and seemed to be in a straight line instead of a Variety formation, but they were too dim to tell specifics.

It had no motor sound or sound at all, but seemed to blend in with the darkness of the sky.  The only way I was able to see it was from the reflection it gave off under the wings.  It had to be about 10 feet wing span.  It moved like a bird would.  Like ascending then coasting.  The only way I was able to see it was from now focusing on it directly."

The craft normally approach from the NW and departs from the same way on which they came.  I live on a hill so I have a good vantage point on the valley.

I watched it & took a video of it for almost 2 minutes as it cruised through the sky @ an elevation higher than a drone would be but way less than an aircraft.  It was hard to distinguish the shape because it honestly looked like it was glowing bright orange & didn’t keep one specific shape.  Very odd. It stayed flying linear until I couldn’t see it anymore but it was definitely the strangest thing I’ve ever seen.  I know what I saw.  My 2 minute video deleted itself once I went back to look at what I had captured & all I was left with was this short clip of the object.  Note the trees to the left of the screen.

At first I saw a bright object in the top left of my windshield, and really had not paid much attention to it.  After about ten seconds or so it was still there and the wheels starting turning in my head.  It’s gloomy out, nearly sunset and something very bright, orangish silver white very large ball in the sky towards STL, but probably past the city.  In my windshield it was about the size of a dime, maybe smaller.  Pretty intense unique glowing orb or sphere, could not see any solidity to it, whatever it was it was big, and powerful, and seemed to be stationary.  I checked my blind spot, changed lanes and it was gone.  Nothing in the sky at all, this was too high to be any sort of land based object, too late in night and gloomy to be a reflection.  I wish I never took my eyes off it because now I will never be able to piece together what I saw or where it went. I cannot believe it was not on the news, or posted online somehow.  This sighting seems similar to some other sightings, but this was not any sort of misidentified jet or craft, no blinking or anything like that, just an intense ball of light..............I am baffled, maybe someone else will come forward, I feel alone on this one."

It moved Northwest to Southeast.  It moved from behind one tree directly overhead across to be behind another.  I guess it would have been under under 5,000 feet, but it was hard to tell.  It was silent as it moved.  It was really freaky.  It looked like solid smoke.  It had no lights and was perfectly shaped.

I am a kind of guy that when he sees something unexplainable like this, he just considers it unknown yet strange.  I have a balcony to which I go out to smoke.  Being as how I live in the city it is very rare to see stars.  So when I recognize something that reminds me of a star I stare at it (I love stars.)  Every time I see an unidentified glowing object or “flying object"" I stare at them to make sure I’m not crazy and or to validate the realness.  I went out to smoke and I noticed the “star” I was looking at was indeed not a star.  And it was seemingly moving against the laws of physics. As if it could go through time or something.  As I noticed that one I had noticed 2 others doing the same thing.  These bluish glowing orbs were moving short distances at breakneck speeds.  I have noticed these same phenomena in the past.  Even having intelligent adults look in wonderment.  That is all that happened in this instance.  The other must tell story is about a year ago during the late summer to fall months.  I had just got to my girlfriends mothers house (I lived there) and on the horizon my girlfriend, her mother, and I had witnessed a giant (10 times bigger than the moon perceptually) orange sphere.  It was almost exactly like the depictions of USO’s.  Except there was no large body of water anywhere near me.  My girlfriends mother just shrugged it off while I was so lost and curious.  There is constant sightings of UFO’s in my area.  We even had a woman In Pittsburgh last august make it on the news for seeing something strange  In the sky.  She calls the police and even the police think its weird.  Wish we could know what the phenomena is or is caused by."

We were outside looking at the stars after having a bonfire. It was about 8:30-9:30 pm and extremely dark outside.  We were looking at the sky and my sister suddenly got really quiet and pointed at this object that was very close to us.  It was an oval shape with about 6 lights around the exterior.  It flew above the tree line, and moved back and forth in the sky, and eventually took off behind the trees.  Some of the lights were blue, orange, and red.  A couple of years earlier, we went to my grandparents house, and we saw the exact same object fly past our car window on the way home at about 9:00 pm.  We stood there shocked, especially me because I saw the same object and it left me with the s! ame feeling.  I hope this organization can look over this encounter and take this message seriously.

My wife, daughter and son retire to bed.  Night before the eclipse.  My oldest son and I decided it was a cool night with a light breeze.  No bugs.  Stars were phenomenal.  We set up chairs facing west northwest.  Beautiful unobstructed view of the stars.  A hint of the Milky Way.  No clouds.  Fire dying out to glowing coals.  Sitting and talking about the Perseids we saw two weeks ago up in Wisconsin, hoping we could catch a few shooting stars.  We catch a few faint ones and then set up our iPhones on the Nightcap app.  Within the app there is a shooting star setting.  It takes a five second open aperture shot on loop.  It keeps clicking off shots until you stop it or it hits 290 shots.  Then it computes how many to save that had light events or movements.  You have to position your phone against a stable object to keep any stars from blurring.  It takes ok shots of meteors, but they stand out against the points of light that are planets and stars.  So my son and I are talking.  We start to see a few faint meteors followed by a few real fire balls.  A good show seeing 1 or 2 about every 20 minutes or so. "

Others would blink on, grow brighter, and race from position to position, moving what I estimate to be about a mile in seconds.  Some would dim and blink out, only to re-appear nearby, growing brighter as they moved rapidly from side to side, then up and down.  The best was a magenta light that changed to a brilliant emerald green color and started blinking rapidly.  This ship stayed close, brilliant  and visible the whole time I was watching.  There was also one very bright stationary magenta craft that followed this same pattern.  I could not make out craft shapes due to their distance from me, however there is no doubt they were intelligently controlled, and in my opinion, 'not from around here'.  It was very interesting that although there were about 30 folks with us watching the fireworks, none saw the lights, or at least none remarked as such.

My first thought was that it was some debris floating on the air currents -  but it was not just floating along  - it was moving quite slowly from east to west.  The object was dark black, shaped like a wide diamond – or a square object on a corner.  It did not appear to reflect light – however I noticed a light that flashed about 4 times in the 10 minutes or so I was looking at it.   I asked a young woman , also waiting for the bus if she saw it – she said yes -  I asked her if it looked like a helicopter?  She said she didn’t think so.  I’m afraid I didn’t get her name, but if I see her again I will ask.  I did try to take some photos – but I don’t believe they show much since the object was so high up and I! ’d think, quite distant.  I can send them if it is requested"

Decided to open my eyes and looked up to see something like a large bubble about 8 or 9 inches wide float by about 25 feet up and at a 50 degree angle from my horizon.  It had two really bright lights inside of it.  One in front and one in back.  The one in back flickered really fast while the one in front was steady in it's brightness.  Then I saw another about 10 seconds later and it continued to about 6 of them at different distances and different angles.  All of them heading east over my building.  The last one I got a video of was the farthest out at about 50 feet away.  I've seen orbs before but never this close and never was able to make out so much detail inside them.  The spherical outline was like a soap bubble but less reflection.  I could barely make out a front and back outline but the 2 white lights! inside were quite clear.  The video doesn't show any of the detail I was able to see with my eyes.  I'm left wondering why?  It appears as the usual white orb only but that's not what I saw.  Hard to see it in the video but it's there mid way down traveling from right to left of the frame.

He called it his “guiding light”.  He thought it was a surveillance drone and if it is, why him?  Well 3 years of this guiding light had him pretty nervous.  I had only heard the stories, until one night we were heading to my mother's house to visit (parents are separated), and before we got out of the driveway, he asked me, “What do you think that is?” and pointed at a very bright light in the sky.  My first thought was:  It’s a planet.  It was bright like Jupiter or Venus.  Until I noticed how low it was and that it seemed to be swaying or hovering.  Then I said it's a drone.

I went to find my binoculars to get a better view.  I came back with them and brought the lights into better focus.  The brighter of the two looked to have about 3 to 4 light panels very clearly visible facing in my direction.  There were what appeared to be more lights! to the top and side because it cast a glow in all directions.   I watched both of these until the disappeared beyond the top of the apt roof line.

While getting into my vehicle, I notice a large light high up in the sky that I thought was the Planet Jupiter, although I thought that it appeared to be 3 to 4 times larger than what I am used to observing from my home in Albuquerque.  As I began driving, I noticed that the object appeared to be shimmering and changing from a golden color to a light shade of red or pinkish orange.  After I had traveled approximately 3 miles, I noticed that the object appeared to be increasing in size.  As I passed the La Cienega exit the object had doubled in size and now appeared to be near the size of a street light and the colors became more vibrant.  The object was gradually  losing altitude and traveling in roughly the same direction as Interstate 25 (from north to south), and appeared to be moving slightly inward toward the interstate.  It became obvious that this was not a commercial aircraft as it appeared to be within a distance of less than 3-5 miles from my location and the object appeared to be at least as big as 2 to 3 airliners.  There were not any other lights on the craft, and no definite shape could be seen due to the brightness of the light the object was emitting.  At this point the object appeared to be at half the altitude it was at when I first observed it, I would estimate somewhere between 3000ft. to 5000ft."
4387,2/24/17 20:30,Payson,AZ,Other,"On 2/24/17 between 20:30 and 21:00 when leaving a resturant in Payson, Arizona, what appeared to be a very bright star was visible in the westrn sky.  In the car we headed west on Highway 260.  The star was high in the sky directly in front of the car.  After going about 1/4 mile we stopped for a traffic light, the light or star made a horizontial movement, then a vertical descent and stayed low on the horizon, my thought was it is a helicopter.  We made a right turn on Highway 87, north bound.  I continued to watch the light out the drivers side window.  We both observed what appeared as though the light was moving parallel to us.  After travelling 1/2 mile I asked the driver to pull into a gas station, the movement of the light also stopped.  The driver exited the car and started videoing the object for several minutes, using the wide angle/ telephoto feature back and forth.  During the video the object changes colors from a solid to multicolor and the shape changes while maintaining a hexagon shape.  Reentering the car and again heading north, another 200 yards, I again asked the driver to stop in a parking lot as it seemed, beyond logic, the light again moved as we did.  After watching for short time and taking more videos I asked the driver to drive the car south while I stood in the parking lot and kept it under observation, it appeared to remain stationary.  Again getting back in the car we drove another block and made a right turn toward my home, stopping in the middle of the road to look behind us, the light was no longer visible."

By that time it only looked like a very bright star and no separate lights in a ring like several minutes before.

Olhei para a janela e vi uma bola branca passando, se deslocando lentamente bem na minha frente, uns 20 metros de distância, voando por cima do telhado da casa vizinha ao prédio onde moro.  De repente a bola parou e fez um giro na minha direção.  Acendeu uma luz forte, como se fosse o farol de uma motocicleta, em minha direção.  Fiquei em choque, não consegui me mover, senti a respiração parando.  De repente a bola girou novamente, seguiu reto por uns 3 metros e subiu, para desviar do edifício à frente, e seguiu adiante, sem nenhuma pressa.  Fiquei paralisada de medo por uns 5 minutos. Voltei para meu quarto e olhei através da cortina, discretamente.  Via maldita bola voltando e pousou na planta que fica rente ao muro da casa vizinha, no jardim do prédio ao lado da casa vizinha (essa casa fica entre 2 prédios na lateral, e outro prédio nos fundos, próximo à duas palmeiras bem altas! no quintal da vizinha, onde papagaios vem se alimentar).  A noite estava clara, céu limpo, não tinha vento.  Mas o galho da planta sacolejava bastante, onde a bola havia pousado.  Peguei minha máquina e comecei a filmar.  Fiquei com medo, desliguei a máquina e telefonei para a policia, pra saber se eles estavam usando algum drone.  A policial que atendeu parece que não gostou do meu telefonema.  Aí liguei para uma amiga que mora algumas quadras do meu prédio. No dia seguinte, chamei a faxineira do meu prédio e fomos ver o galho da planta.  Ele estava meio destruído, parecendo que foi queimado ou que alguém arrancou as folhas, o galho estava pendurado. Minha amiga falou que, se for ovni, eles estavam pesquisando a plantinha. Foi muito assustador, meu coração dispara quando lembro disso e quero esquecer.  Em função do que minha amiga falou, sobre os ets estarem pesquisando as nossas plantas, é que hoje decidi relatar o ocorrido e espero que essa informação lhes seja útil de alguma ! forma.  Tenho 60 anos, não tomo bebidas alcólicas, nunca usei drogas ne m tomo remédios.  Não acreditava em ovnis, até que me aconteceu isso, e espero que não se repita, pois é apavorante.

At first I thought it was something like a plastic bag floating, but it was very high up.  Then I noticed at least a dozen more.  So I thought it was maybe balloons or something released, but I could clearly see they looked a lot like bags.  Which is very possible, but I could also make out even smaller objects floating around the bags in what looked like circles.  Maybe those could have been little birds flying around a swarm of really big floating bags.  But the thing is, the bags were floating in the opposite direction of the clouds.  Everything was at least below the cloud layer today.  They didn't look like craft or anything, but it was really, really odd. It was like a huge swarm of these things just floating by with little things slowly orbiting around the big things."
