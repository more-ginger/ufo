As we travelled further it was clear the object was not moving and we drove by the object as it stayed still in the sky.  Looking at the object from the rear view window it still had not moved after we had drove by.  We could no longer see the white light, but instead two flashing red lights on opposite sides and two small solid (not flashing) white lights on opposite sides in somewhat of a square pattern of lights.  All passengers in the vehicle assessed the object as we drove and agreed it did not move.  We described it like a “plane sized drone not moving”.

It was round in shape and started as a pin dot then the dot was moving downward and after about 5 seconds moving slowly downward the brightness and size grew very quickly and then when it was its brightest it quickly shrank toward the center and waa as gone.

It zipped south-eastward in the same trajectory as my car, veered northward and down before it just blinked out.  It was much too low & fast for the distant flights ascending/descending out of DIA and much too fast for the smaller planes allowed in the immediate Centennial airspace.  The light was more solidly encompassing, rather than just a twinkle on a plane or helicopter.  My car was the only one on the road in all directions at 5am so there were no head- or tail-lights anywhere in the vicinity to have been reflected on my car windows or against anything external.  I've never seen anything like this before until last month when my husband and I both were startled by a nearly identical occurrence.  Two sightings of my own seems both noteable and worthy of reporting."

We were coming from Grandville, Michigan heading towards Holland and were about a mile or two from the exit 55 towards Zeeland/Holland and US-31. As we were driving I saw 7 white lights that looked like they were lower than the majority of the stars in the sky. They we’re all in a row and we’re all evenly spaced. They weren’t low enough to see any detail in their shape but the constant pattern and equal spacing intrigued me. It reminded me of the airport when the planes lined up to land.  As we continued driving some started to disappear and leave a bigger Gap in between the others. At one point if I remember correctly an additional light popped up but it was only for a little bit. So technically there were eight at one time. But for the most part I saw seven. After that I saw the second and third light disappear then return as bright as before. Once we reac! hed exit 55 the last two in the row faded out and by the time we passed the exit there were  only about 1 or 2 faint ones left. I tried to take photos but I was on the highway and it was too dark. At for I thought it was a Star constellation but new once I saw the number of them in a row that it most likely was not. It was very interesting to see."

There was no sound and it was hard to tell how high they were but I would guess a few thousand feet off the ground.  There were no clouds in the sky so I don't know why the lights would disappear and they got to a certain point in the sky.  I'm just wondering if anyone else in the area seeing the same thing.

The lights were very small, but he knew something was off about tthem. Once he had me outside I looked up to the sky and I too saw the line of lights. Before he told me he thought they were moving I brought it up. He told me to go get the binoculars to get a slightly better look. When I came back out and looked up I started to shake immensely. I saw that they were moving very fast. As I watched the front object move forward past other lights in the sky it suddenly disappeared. My stepdad had watched it disappear too because he asked me if it just vanished from the sky. Then I took off the binoculars and noticed you could see about 6 at a time in a straight line with even gaps between them moving at about the same speed. Once one disappeared another appeared on the horizon. Eventually there was only one left and we watched it as it flew then suddenly disap! peared from view. We stood outside for a couple more minutes discussing what we had just witnessed. P.s. How they just vanished from sight kind of reminded me of in Star Wars when they go into hyper speed. That by far was the scariest thing I have ever witnessed and probably will witness in my entire life."

300,12/21/19 19:00,<br/>,VA,Light,"Approx 7pm on Dec 21, 2019 i was outside and noticed what i thought was maybe a big meteor or similar object. It was very big and bright white colored light in the N.E direction of the sky. It was VERY clear since the moon was not visible. It was the only light in the entire sky at the angle we were seeing it from.  It would hover, then move, hover & start moving again for quite a few minutes(5). Then it just suddenly just took off across the dark sky. My mother and I both witnessed this amazingly bright and odd acting ""ufo"". The moon is not visible tonight and it was about a 30% visibility in the sky but this light was extremely obvious. You couldn't miss this thing. Within the first 2 mins of this sighting we also saw 4 military planes heading(VERY close together)coming from the West heading to the N.E. direction this light originated from. The size MASSIVE & it was so noticeable in the sky it was strange. After about 5 mins watching the light pi! cked up speed and just simply zipped very quickly completely across the viewable sky. It was heading SW. We watched in total about 8-ish mins until it was no longer visible at our location. This was NOT the ISS, nor was it an aircraft we're familiar with. It would glid, then hover, then it would glid again,then hover...it repeated this for the majority of the time it was observed. The 4 airplanes we seen were making a very quick B-line to the NE sky. It was obvious they were together as well as they were heading to rd the same destination with clear hast. I've seen anomalies in the sky quite often lately but I've never witnessed something as massive or as obvious as this was. It was AMAZING. The lights were a bright white color, the shape was hard to make out but did seem like a sphere shape. There were no sounds from this object heard. It did actually have a aura around it, kind of similiar to a fog that faded out. The entire sphere was illuminated from our location. All o! ne color. The light did seem to brighten, then fade .... Then ! brighten and fade, it repeated this pattern until it quit hovering. When it would brighten the light would increase in size but the color remained the same. It was Unnatural lighting, anti gravity movements and impossible speed. It went from one end of the sky to the other within about 3 mins and was SO big and bright it IMMEDIATELY was noticeable and odd. It was drastically different and unusually bright from any the norm that anyone actually looking would have seen this with amazing ease!"

I looked outside to see three saucer (dinner plate) sized UFOs hoovering about a foot off the deck.they were moving in a spinning motion it seemed ,though they spun at a rate in which its hard to say spinning with accuracy.  The one in the middle was slightly larger and had a very soft glow, luminance and the outside rim was flipping up and down intermittently, but there was no noticeable hinge or break in its solid form.my first thought was I wasn't seeing this and I looked away,on second glance I looked away and rubbed my knuckles into my eyes to ""clear"" them.on third glance I thought if these are moving then they must be displacing air.there was a weird distortion around them similar to heat rising from a road, but this was night and I only noticed this distorted air around these three objects, the larger one being in the middle with the other two on each side of it.only the one in the middle had a noticeable luminous glow.there were leaves on the deck approximately a foot under them,  and mere inches below the distortion.  My thought was they would be moving with these objects moving above them but they were absolutely still.i feel I must say that sometimes I am more brave then smart.if I believe people or animals to have been on the property I would investigate, sometimes running flat out to the potential threat to my home, family or pets.  I had an unexplainable dread,a terror wash over me and I backed myself out of the room trembling. I was stuttering and stammering unable to take my eyes from the bedroom door as I tried to speak when my fiance took note of my behavior and asked what was wrong in a concerned tone  .i had an image that kept playing over and over in my mind that also is inexplicable.

I noticed a helicopter flying semi-low and thought that was odd for that area but ignored the oddness. I then looked to the right side of the sky and saw the large sphere/ball in the sky. It wasn't moving, just holding it's position in the sky. I noticed that helicopter I saw was flying AWAY from this craft. It was a large silver/chrome ball and I only saw it because the sun was reflecting off of it like crazy! I tried to grab my phone and it totally vanished.  Cloaking or some kind of invisibility as it didn't move at all.  Once I got pulled over,  I noticed other planes in an odd area (not a normal fly zone, never see planes around here, no hospitals or helicopter pads, no airport, etc.) and it was so high up I could barely see the dark  colored plane. Didn't see the silver sphere after that."

Next thing you know the light has a trail behind it rapidly growing longer and longer it had colors inside the trail of whites and orange and yellow and it was stretching across the sky not up or down.

The light was blinking red, white, and green in the same arythmic display as a modern commercial airplane, but very bright, much brighter than normal craft. However I passed this off as a plane, being an 8yr airforce vet I was around all sorts of aircraft and nothing caught my attention of being abnormal."

When the second object got close to the first object, it started moving again, but changed its heading to the northeast.  The second object followed on the same course. I watched the two bright amber lights travel northeast until they became so dim I lost sight of them.  There was no sound associated with either objects."

352,12/19/19 19:40,Belleville,KS,Sphere,"Sighting was at 7:40 pm, Saturday December 19th, 2019, In Belleville, KS.    As I was driving west down Hwy 36 with my 12 year old daughter, I noticed a bright star/planet in the sky. Then I noticed it would fade as it traveled up in a 45 degree angle. I pulled over into an empty lot and started watching. That is when I noticed it was a pattern of lights traveling in this angle. As one Began to burn brightly above the tree line out of no where and start going up, the one before it would get lighter, the one  before that would get dimmer, and the last would burn out. My daughter stepped out from the van to see what dad was watching and started yelling, ""what is that?"" All I could say with disbelief was, ""I don't know... I don't know""   We watched as this pattern continued for 30 seconds or more. I tried to take film, but my phone would not get a clear shot because of the street lights. It almost looked like it could be a large spinning object because the lights would just start in the atmosphere and move from south west to north west in that same angle 20 feet above the tree line. the objects were not rising from earth, but starting in the sky and ending in the upper part of the sky line. The pattern would start left and go right. and when the last Light started up, it was a bigger and brighter golden ball then the others and took longer to fade out as it went from south west to north west in night sky. it was just amazing to watch these lights start glowing out of no where and move left to right. I have included a picture I put together of what we saw and in the horizon area we watched it. best part was my daughter was able to witness this too."

355,12/19/19 19:00,Mesa,AZ,Unknown,"I was travelling on Loop 202 Beeline Highway heading West . Coming from the South were two perfectly round dull green lights on opposite ends of each other but directly across from each other about the distance of a medium to small size airplanes wing span.  These two lights did NOT blink at all and they were not bright like a conventional aircraft or helicopter as to be used for the purpose of seeing out ahead of where it was going. There were  (zero) no other lights whatsoever on this UFO. As it approached closer towards the highway and right when it got almost directly above me the light on the right side (as Im looking at it coming towards me) turned a reddish color and with the same dim and dull appearance. The craft that was flying was completely dark ,so i couldnt make out the actual shape of it. I thought I seen a quick glimpse of the craft as a other source of low light reflected off of it and It appeared to be like a flat triangle shape. The color ! of the craft was a grayish dull steel appearance with intricate box shaped  or square parts on the exterior located towards the center . I know it sounds like I seen alot but I really didnt and it happened so quick that the only image i have in memory to describe it. The craft also wasnt very high off the ground . It was a few hundred feet in the air . I completely lost sight of it after it flew over my car towards Red Mountain . After that main sighting there were 4 seperate bright super bright lights that hovered out South of Phoenix and North West of Phoenix.  2 each on each side of the 202. There were multiple helicopters flying out between these white lights as well as commercial aircraft coming in and out of Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. The Airplanes and Helicopters are extremely easy to identify whether they are far or near. There was alot of activity in Phoenix at 7pm . I hope others that witnessed what i seen has the inclination to report it as well .. I got footage! of the white lights (4) of them on video on my camera phone. ! I wish I could of captured the dull green lights on the craft that was super close to me, but i wasnt thinking fast enough to get that . that one would even have the Pope believing without a doubt there are UFOs"

It flew pretty low to the ground, I gained speed and I could see it going far away but then when I took a turn all of a sudden I saw it in front of me and the helicopter lost it. I then saw it lowering down to the ground, so low I couldn't see it behind some houses about 1000 feet away when I drove past the houses where the UFO was I saw it flying at the same distance from the ground foward and then it gained speed losing track of it. The UFO had a long strip of a white light and a yellowish light on the front. Also when I came home there were two fading lines in the sky."

I would say it was closer than any other object I have seen in the sky before like airplanes or shooting stars.  It fell slowly and then disappeared into the darkness in the blink of an eye after about 5-7 seconds.  Me and my husband were in awe and excited to have witnessed this!

When i looked to the left i looked up to the sky and seen yellow lights, about five of them connected to each other. They were so close to each other they looked like 5 little bulbs of christmas lights. I looked back down because there was a tree beside them, so in my mind i thought they were actually christmas lights, but when i looked up again i realized they weren’t because that tree wasn’t decorated. Plus that tree was very tall and its not the kind of tree people hang lights on. The lights were at the very top beside the tree. I turned left and looked up again to keep track of them but they disappeared. All this happened in a span of a minute. I told my girlfriend about them but we never saw them again. There was also a few planes in the sky, kind of close to the object/objects( i don’t know if it was one object with five lights) b! ut not to close.

They were stationary and did not move for a few seconds, and all of a sudden they both moved downward at an incredible speed, with seemingly no acceleration.  As they descended, it seemed that they came together a bit, to form what would have been a V, with both of their original positions as the top forks of the V, and their trajectory heading downward toward a common point.  The left light started to descend first, followed after a split second by the right light. They seemed to move at the same speed, though it was so fast that I couldn't measure the speed.

It fell as if falling from an invisible opening in the sky... the night was a crystal clear night sky  so no clouds or precipitation to obstruct our view and the object was closer than any I have ever witnessed before.

So me being curious turned around to check it out, as I did I video taped it to send it to my friend I was hanging out with, joking about seeing as a ufo, but as I was taking the video, I slowed down and realized to my horror it really was moving like a ufo, and as I was stopped there, it started moving towards me and I started going again, on the video you can see that my view was lost momentarily behind a barn, as I gained sight again it was moving somehow instantly much closer to me .

I was traveling just under the speed limit of 35mph, and it was easily doing 3 times that.  As it traveled past me, i saw something break away from the main and it too was seemingly on fire, but more of a quick flash.  The main was at about a 25 degree angle so i estimate that whatever it was probably landed near the next cemetery on up.

This part of the country is farming country, and in the warmer months it's common to see hawks circling high in the sky, looking for prey on the ground.  But now we have snow cover and its hard to imagine hawks being able to see any little critters running around down here with all of our snow cover.  Plus, I have NEVER seen a bird that high!

There may have been more that preceded the ones I saw but I can only vouch for the ones I saw when I first looked up at the sky. I watched until no more passed by.

I sat on a chair and stared up at the beauty of the stars shining over the lake. I noticed a couple of what I thought might be planes flying overhead, I was not sure but thought they may be flying to a nearby airport in Ottawa. But I soon noticed one after the other flying right over my head, in a direct line. After at least 20 flew by, I ran inside the cottage and woke my husband and he got up and came out to see them. By this time another friend heard us and he got up and also witnessed the same thing. They looked like bright lights flying overhead, one after the other and spaced evenly. Every so ofter, two would kind of come together and fly off in the same pattern. Right over our heads travelling east over the lake. I have never seen anything like it. My friend had his phone so he took a picture of the sky, and the flash went off. The sightings stopped right after the fl! ash."
860,11/25/19 05:00,Oroville,CA,Other,"Just before sunrise on the morning of the 25th of November 2019 I was sitting in my hot tub with three other friends at my property near bald rock in berry creek California and we were observing satellites and discussing them when we saw what looked like four satellites very close to each other moving from the west to towards the east. They were in a staggered line formation, all traveling the same speed and direction, approximately the same speed a satellite moves, but a bit slower, and at first we thought they were satellites on a similar orbit. As the objects passed from our far left to far right field of vision we began seeing more and more of these objects essentially moving in a staggered line formation and stretching for well over a mile. It took at least three minutes for them to all pass to the far right of our field of view and out of sight. There were several triangle formations within this staggered line but it appeared they were three separate o! bjects, not on me triangular shaped object. There was no sound and no bright lights. Just a steady line of these dots that were unambiguously remarkable. The sky was completely clear and there were no clouds. After approx two minuites of watching I ran to get another friend who confirmed what we were seeing as he was still able to see about ten of these objects in the last minute or so that they were visible so that makes five witnesses total. . I have seen many strange things out in the mountains where I live because there is very little light pollution but this was single handed lay the most incredible thing I’ve ever seen."

I noticed a small gray object 30-35 degrees above the horizon, traveling straight west.  At first I thought it was simply a ""floater"" in mt eye, but then realized it was going straight west at a rapid pace.  Trimont lies six miles north of Interstate 90, which travels straight east to west through this area, and I wondered if this object was following the Interstate toward Sioux Falls, SD.  When the object was roughly straight south of us it seemed to drastically increase its speed, and joined another object that was just ahead of it and also traveling west.  I hadn't noticed this object until the gray object pulled along side of it.  This object appeared to be black in color.  Just a second later the two objects became lost amid nearby tree branches, and that was the end of the event.  This whole occurrence couldn't have lasted more ! than 3-5 seconds.

955,11/22/19 23:03,Lawton,MI,Cylinder,At approximately 10:30 p.m. which ran to 11 03 which is the 2300 hour. Call was made to 911 Van Buren county dispatch to see if anyone else had noticed strange lights and occurrences within the atmosphere above the Van Buren county area towards the Lakeshore which occurred at about 5 to 8000 feet above sea level. Former military aviator with vast experience witness strange occurrencesand attempted to contact the FAA which was closed at 11 and the Kalamazoo international airport. The lights that were witnessed initially discovered by his spouse moving in an easterly direction coming from the West over the boundaries of Decatur township and Porter township in Lawton Michigan the lights that were seen where multiple in the sky as the sky was very clear and luminescent with multiple Stars however the lights that were seen we're altering and multi changing very fastwhat's led into the question the shape of the aircraft that were being witnessed it appeared that t! hey were cigar shaped at a distance long and cylindrical larger than an average aircraft without fixed wings there was one main light that was off in the distance that seemed to be stationary during the entire doing of this anomaly which added an ominous and unsettling feeling coming and going around it attempting to use cellular video cellular video the capture what was being witnessed in the sky this reporting individual made several attempts to adequately identify the unknown anomalies currently at the time of this writing the main lights in the distance that are alternating are still relevant and predominant the smaller lights in aircraft if that's what they can be called have been no longer visible as they were as they were. Upon retrieving a set of Minolta binoculars binoculars this writer adjusted this looking device to see clearly into the night sky upon doing so the first aircraft which was actually cylindrical in shape move quickly over the top of his location and! disappeared in the distance in a relatively short time withou! t any so und however a second aircraft came in the opposite direction a short time later and shook the home without really giving a sound the spouse of the writer was inside the home and clearly stated she heard something big come over the house. It is something that I have never seen in my lifetime very intrigued yet terrifying. Dogs in the distance can be heard barking continually yet when the call was placed to the 911 dispatch no other report has been given to them at that time as per the operator that took fielded the call. After hanging up immediately a call was made to the FAA but their office had been closed other than seeing the bright lights and as the aircraft or cylindrical object moved over the home which was obviously the size have a Navy destroyer or or frigate something that large was impossible to be explained as it went over...you could not hear the aircraft but you could feel the vibration of it almost as if it was a magnified presence which had some sort of cloaki! ng technology or you can see the framework the framework of The Craft and its lights clearly it looked as if it was interdimensional within itself and as it picked up speed it look to have deployed something really really wide coming out that could be only described as wing. The distance that you can see from this location is over 20 miles on a clear night the object disappeared within a matter of moments heading towards the Lakeshore beyond the coloma st.joe area... It is left this writer an experienced professional military man speechless and dumbfoundead having experienced many unique aircraft throughout a long military career nothing that I have seen could be described other than a flying massive grain silo. Which so difficult to describe the mechanics of looking inside of it as it went over the home it was utterly amazing. I'm refusing to go back outside to even look at it because I cannot believe it for myself and I witnessed it with my own eyes.

Driving in the left lane, it was quite dark at that time.  The sun wasn't anywhere near coming up that early this late in the year. I noticed a small orange light break the west treeline. Th light quickly maneuvered in a zig zag line as it rose into the sky and the moved over the southbound lanes of GA400 and then just hovered, about 100' off the ground, until I drove under it.  At first, I thought it was a helicopter, not uncommon as ATL traffic gets underway.  But as I got closer, I realized it most definitely was not a helicopter.  It was a dirty/burnt orange light. Bright enough to see from a distance but not as bright as say a parking lot light.  Not sure if it made any sound as I was driving in the left lane with the windows up.  Could have been a drone, but odd to see a drone that early in the morning, over 400 and in those temperatures...I drive that way every day, at the same time. Been doing it for 11years and that is the 1st time I have ever seen anything like that."

Using a $900 pair of night vision goggles I have seen a set of two very hot very columns coming off two lower sides of the craft  When I describe them as “showing themselves” I mean that on a very bright night in the middle of a city while overcast with scattered altocumulus clouds, these objects appeared to me with the brightness of a shooting star while not moving except for abnormal jaunts to nearby static positions.

However what caught my attention was I could tell the object was much bigger than the light portrayed.  There was a strange magnetic or electrical field or haze camouflaging the craft.  The light would be in one spot and almost instantly be across the sky.  It moved kinda like in a zig zag way.  Seemed like erratic movement.  It was absolutely silent.  No sound whatsoever.  At first I thought a strange aircraft was emitting a dangerous gas on the entire city.  It seemed to stop and I saw a strange electrical aura like gas descending from out the bottom.  Then I realized the craft was just descending straight down because it suddenly shot straight up and over and the auto around it went with it.  It was like I could see through whatever field was around it and could tell the objective was to be stealth. Never witnessed anything like it in my life.  I have a 4.5 minute video of it.

On 11-05-19...7:06 pm my neighbor (42 year old female) called asking me to go outside to see some strange orange lights in the sky. She said she had never seen anything like it before. I & my stepdaughter, age 17, went outside on my south facing 2nd floor porch. I'd say we were outside by 7:10 pm. At first we didn't see anything. There was the sound of a plane going over but not extremely loud & that soon passed. Approximately 5 min after we went out, my stepdaughter saw first, then I saw, 3 or 4 clear, bright, orange round balls of light in a cluster. They were at around 45° and in the southeast direction. They seemed close, though I'm unable to give any estimate of distance. They suddenly appeared and after no more than 5 seconds had all disappeared again. They seemed to disappear sequentially, not all at once. No sounds at all were heard at this time. I thought possibly flares, but, like I said, there was no ! sound of any planes or helicopters in the sky. And also, these seemed to be not far from me, in a very populated residential area. Why would anyone be dropping flares in such an area? We waited but didn't see any more balls of light. However, about 5 minutes later, we both saw just inside the bottom of a low cloud an oval appearing white light, much larger than the orange lights. It flashed on just once, for a few seconds, that we saw. It was mild with patchy clouds & light breeze that night. Although it has rained earlier in the day, there were no storms or lightning in the area. It made us wonder if the small orange lights could have been dropped from whatever the oval white light represented. I've never seen anything resembling this before."

1396,11/3/19 04:00,Sumpter,SC,Circle,Yesterday afternoon my family and I were outside tossing a football. We decided to take a break in the trampoline. My husband was the first to spot these UFOs then myself and my son. There was a large fleet of UFOs moving toward the sun. Most were circles withered flashing white and blue lights. There were also a few crafts that were larger in size. Silver and saucer shaped.2 of the circular crafts flew behind the cluster of crafts.they made slower left to right movements. They also had some type of smoke coming from the back of the craft.one of the crafts from the cluster took off east at an extremely fast speed. We are all pretty shook up.

1399,11/3/19 00:45,Whittier,CA,Triangle,One cluster (cluster A) was flying low in the sky (like a typical airplane height) and was being paced by a much smaller single light. The smaller light eventually continued at a faster pace towards the north/west until it disappeared. Then at a much higher position another cluster of lights (cluster B) appeared moving across the sky south to north. Both clusters eventually lined up one above the other but from my perspective they were probably on the same “plane.” At this point they both rose higher and went in opposite directions. I lost sight of cluster B as it headed more towards the west and was getting smaller until it blended in with the stars in the sky (size wise). Cluster A was much more easier to track as it headed towards the east and almost directly above me. Both clusters when I first saw them were much larger in scale almost blimp like or hot air balloon in size. Cluster A kept getting higher and also starting to blend in with the size of the ! night stars. Cluster A moved close to the Little Dipper and then headed back towards the west where the light pollution eventually made it almost impossible to keep track of. I actually laid down on the ground to monitor cluster A because my neck started to hurt. I tracked it for over 40 minutes. I also have very grainy iPhone footage that I hastily filmed for 3 minutes but is very hard to see because of the distance. But you can see both clusters as they lined up with each other shortly after I first saw them.

As I was fixed on looking at these two stars that were very clear to see, one of them moved quick  to the left, and then moved extremely fast across the sky and disappeared. As soon as I first saw it move, I told my friend to look, but it disappeared so fast he didn’t get a chance to look. They laughed when I told them why I wanted them to look. It just looked like a star, until it moved the way it did. No shooting star could make such a sharp angle the way it did, nor would it accelerate from a stand still. It has been weighing on my mind because it was so bizarre, and I wish someone else witnessed it because I know what I saw."

It got louder apparently as the object approached. When I realized it was not a car.  I immediately ran to the balcony.  Lucky enough to just barely catch a glimpse of it. It was moving very fast. And was maybe only 3 to 600 ft. above me. There was NO WAY THIS WAS A HELICOPTER, AIRPLANE OR ANYTHING THAT WE SEE ALL THE TIME. I do not know what it was. All I know is it was something different. The humming vibration sound it had, did not last as long once it passed overhead. There were lights on it.  It passed over so fast I only had a second if that too see it.

When watching this, one of the eastern flying aircraft did a U turn and starting flying west.  Focusing on the north northwestern flying object, it began to rotate in a corkscrew motion.  At this moment I attempted to grab my cell phone but as the western aircraft pasted infront of the other object it faded into black or just got to far away to see.

The lights hovered at what seemed to be 1000 feet in altitude if I had to guess.  After about 15 seconds of visual all four lights ascended vertically at a rapid pace and eventually disappeared into thin air.  I was in the military for 8 years.  No man made aircraft or drone could have accelerated at that speed vertically.  I suppose that if it was any aircraft at JBER it would have made a sonic boom that I could have heard from my location, however no noise was heard.

I could tell it was an airplane because it had a blinking red light on the bottom and the wing lights were red and green. I then noticed more lights moving and observed an unidentified flying object crossing my field of vision from the south heading northwest. It was two pairs of amber lights flying at a seemingly slow pace. It would have had to be daylight to be sure but I am reasonably confident that the object was above the usual altitude for VFR flight but it seemed much closer and larger than a commercial aircraft which would place it somewhere between two and six thousand feet in my estimation. I have had some ground school and flight sim experience but not enough to identify altitudes at night confidently. The object increased in speed and flew off ! to the northwest."

Then without a sound it wizzed above and past my house.   As it past and got closer. I noticed it was triangular in shape and black but had three round lights on the bottom.

I had a very good view of the south sky as well as west and east other than some trees on the west side of my view.  I was sitting in my truck on the phone facing south.  Sunny afternoon. I noticed what looked like a meteor very white like a cloud, shaped like a falling sphere of white gas.  Very white, and looked more like a cloud than anything else, but it was traveling west to east at a 45 degree angle coming down towards the earth. It had a tail that would shrink and than get longer every few seconds. suddenly it faced straight downward like it was falling from the sky. I video taped the entire event, but my phone camera did not seem to pick up the image. I looked out beyond my camera as it was recording and I could see it perfectly, and when I returned my vision to the camera it wasn't in the viewing area recording.  It went west to east.  a je! t plane like a 747 through right through my line of sight of the object.  The 747 looked 1/10th the size.  I am sure the pilot(s) on that jet saw the object.  The object also had very small white popping lights like a sizzler but far less lights popping. I lost sight as it went down beyond my line of vision of the trees but looked like it was going to land somewhere.  Hope someone else had seen this and reports it as I have."

They all looked see through and like large circles of clouds or white smoke as if they were possibly trying to cloak within the clouds. They literally appeared to be large cloud like circles moving different directions and quickly...we saw about 8 total over 30 minutes. I absolutely believe this to be a UFO and a very strange one at that. They almost looked more organic in nature than like a metal made machine. No lights were seen on or around th! em...they were more just translucent. Three people in my family also saw these and agree they were not only incredibly strange but not of this earth.  This occurred within the city of Tulsa Oklahoma.  I did see a older video post on the UK Mirror that looked very much like the craft saw. These in this post were seen during the day and looked like smoke circles as well. Considering they were more than one makes me think this could be a fleet traveling.No sounds were heard with these at all."

Twice they were pulsing, but there was only one object. Last night it was two solid, large and bright objects that just appeared.

So I know generally where the stars are located at what times. It looked as if there were more stars than usual this morning. Very bright white. Seemed as if 2 bright white lights side by side but connected. But glowing round. Thinking dang thats a bright star. But seemed about the right size and distance. Then it started moving east or northeast I believe. About the speed of a 20-40 passenger craft. A bit slower maybe. Then sped up to much faster than a prop plane. Then seemingly changed from 2 bright white lights to one glowing firery rust orange ball of light that zoomed farther away and then straight up to where I could faintly see because of its altitude, and then seemed to evaporate almost. Then nothing. No sound throughout this ordeal. Ive seen plenty of planes and jets at night. Plenty of stars.! Plenty of sattelites growing up on a lake in the Forrest. This was none of those."

Pilot stated right before take-off that we’d be going up to 31,000 ft and we would in the air for 43 minutes.  We were over the coastal mountains following the San Andreas fault.  About halfway, I could see the highway 41 and 46 split (were James Dean died).  Minutes later, I saw this glowing object across the San Joaquin Valley to the southeast.  It appeared to be at mountain ridge level. I guess that would be the southern end of the Sierra Nevada range.  I would estimate that it was whatever the mountains are due east of Bakersfield.   The object was rectangular and either glowed, or reflected the sun. It had a red color to it, like if sun was reflecting off of red colored foil. The size had to be huge.  I’m looking at it from quite a distance over on the coast range side of the valley.  The shape looked like one of those rectangular banners being pulled by an airplane over events.  But since it appeared to be so far away, it would not be possible for it to be that big.  My estimate would be a couple of miles in length.  As I tried to get my phone out to record, the “glowing/reflectiveness” of it would slowly fade in or out.  I tried to record it on 2 separate devices but none of them came out.  After observing this for about 10 minutes, it stopped and the plane veered to the right and went over the mountains above Santa Barbara and Ventura.  I checked to see if perhaps it was a forest fire and I happened to just catch the moment when the bright flames crested the mountains, but could not find such news.  The horizon was hazy, but there wasn’t any sign of smoke from a fire."

2210,9/30/19 00:00,Conyers,GA,Sphere,"I thought it was a plane initially as it came towards me it's lights looked similar...until it passed over me with a complete striped lit up undercarriage separate from the running lights that seemed to circle it's corner points on the side, similar to a plane's...except it had 2 BIG TAIL LIGHTS. Wide set apart and too far apart to be attached to the tail and obviously not on a wing. The tail lights proceeded to alternate from on, off, just the left on, just the right on, double right only like a wink or Morse code and etc.  It was not a set pattern or flashing lights like on all the other aircraft that passes over me.  Also the undercarriage stripes light lit up the bottom from nose to tail (which is why I thought it was a plane initially) but that coupled with the circle of running lights on its sides around it after it was headed away from me gave it a distinctly spherical shape as if the lights were separate from a different object within.... Like those gr! avity things they used to have at Chuck E Cheese they'd strap a kid in and then spin a bunch of metal circles separately from the ring you were strapped in spinning in...  Then 1 minute later....after my shock at the tail lights seeming to say hello to me...there was suddenly a bright light in the sky that blinked out right after it appeared...almost like a star in the sky suddenly turned on brighter and then blew out like a lightbulb....that was behind me, where the UFO first appeared...because I walked across my field mesmerized watching the tail lights...and then while walking back is when the bright light happened in a flash."

The intersect of the satellites flight path and the object flight path was between 32 degrees - 40 degrees.  The object was at a very high altitude.  It is possible the object was at a higher altitude to the satellite.  I continued to watch it until it was out of my range of sight. I lost visibility as it passed the constellation Orion.

It had sharply defined borders and appeared to be made of metal because once the sun started setting the light was reflecting off of it making it appear to change color. I had an uneasy feeling and my gps started malfunctioning. I took two videos in the area (one of the craft) ten minutes apart yet the location stamps marked them as being almost two hours away from each other. I would have pulled over to take a clearer video but I had a very unsettling feeling that I shouldn't do so as there was hardly anyone around.  I did see a truck pulled over on the side of the road with a man who was staring at it.   craft didn't appear to be moving, but it was clear that it was, just very slowly.  I was able to keep it in sight for 45 minutes to an hour before the sun went down and I couldn't see it anymore. I had my cat in the car and she was freak! ing out and meowing loudly for about half an hour as we drove under it. I had a feeling of being watched and the rest of the drive took me much longer than it should have. Very confused about that part as it seems I lost a couple of hours. I was experiencing a lot of neck pain afterwards and when I finally got to a motel to sleep for the night (around midnight) I woke up a couple of hours later with excruciating neck pain. No dreams either which was strange for me but then again I didn't sleep that long. Turns out I sprained my neck somehow."

It was around 330am and I had been looking up all night because the stars were amazing.  Directly east, I saw a light way off in the distance, which I first thought was a star but it began to move.  My second thought it was a shooting star because it was dropping but then it  made a sharp left, then straight back up. I had to rub my eyes to make sure it wasn't an illusion.  My next thought was it was a satellite, but then it dropped straight down again.  All of this was happening in the same location, and I knew this because I was using a star for reference.  Once my brain realized what I was seeing I woke people up and it made a left and took off faster than any aircraft would and covered a huge distance in a matter of 1 second.  My friend caught the last bit of it.  I have seen UFOs before in northern Michigan and Washington (which only hovered) but I've never witnessed any aerial gymnastics like this.

We always see the regular bright stars.  Tonight I noticed next to a regular bright star we see every night, there was another star that was traveling at a steady speed.  It caught my attention as it was traveling through the night sky.  The night sky was very clear and we can see stars and planes and helicopters in the night sky.  But next to this thing there was no air traffic.  It looked like any other star but it seemed very low in the atmosphere, meaning it seemed like it was right above the city.  Also I noticed there were no blinking lights as it traveled above us. By this time my wife came out and I pointed it our to her.  She was perplexed and couldn’t believe what she was seeing, she kept asking what in the heck was it.  There were no blinking lights and the object was moving in a steady flight pattern!, but there was no sound at all associated to it.  Also, as we were watching in the clear night sky I moved few feet ahead of me to get a better view and both my wife and I lost it, It seemed like it just vanished even though we could see the whole sky where it was heading.  I have no clue what it was. I managed to get it on cell phone but against the dark night sky on video it looks like I was just shooting a star in the sky and it doesn’t seem to be moving like we could see with our naked eyes.  I think it’s because there is no other object to reference in the video so it just looks like a star.  But this thing was moving and looked like a star meaning like pinpoint in the sky size of a star if you look up and see one.  It was white in color, no other colors on it like we are used to seeing so many planes because of the Burbank airport right next to us."

Planes also have blinking red lights on them as well and this object didn’t.  When I got closer to the lights I noticed a few cars pulled off on the side of the interstate to get a good look at it.

Flying southeast, it appeared to be in our atmosphere, but faint, we were unable to visibly make out its exact definition. But whatever it was, it was huge. We had our phones with us, but captivated by the sight, we didnt record it. This what we saw. Its hard to describe, but here we go. It was larger than 2 football fields, at least ten blinking white lights simultaneously, equally short distance from each other, formed in a straight line of the direction of flight (like from tip to nose).  It was slow moving, gliding overhead.  As it passed, we began to make out multiple (~20) red and blue lights blinking simultaneously, which formed triangle at the tail, another triangle midway/center on the left side and other the right. Sorry, my description is horrible. BTW: we were not on any substance, totally sober. I highly doubt it's ET - proba! bly military, it was an incredible sight. Any insight?"

As it got closer I noticed that it was not a bird but rather a white ball shaped object flying at a steady rate. There were no propellers or any type of exhaust or thrust producing mechanisms. It just moved under the plane at a steady rate. It’s difficult to determine an exact size because it was below me and appeared by be ~ 20 fee above the water. If I Were to guess I would say 2-3 ft. in diameter. I have never see a UFO in my life, I’m not sure what this was but it was very strange. No one else on the plane made a comment that I could hear."

We went outside to check it out because it seemed particularly low and loud, and it was maybe half mile or so above the ground, Using radar or something in the nose we could see the green light.  It was flying west to east at full speed as far as we could tell.  Once it got almost directly overhead, maybe 20 degrees straight in front of us, we noticed a light orb turn on, orange in color, about 200 to 300 feet in front of the helicopter get bright and then take off in front of the helicopter.  The orb was right on top of us again about a half mile up.  It took off East and then veered Northeast.  The helicopter sped up a little bit and went in pursuit.  We did see the light go out it seemed like it wasn't a flare or a missile, because it didn't come from the helicopter it came from in front of the helicopter turned on and then ! had a burst of speed and then turned off.  Not to mention there is desert/Mesa all around us why launch a missile over the suburbs?  There's no way that's what we saw.

So all around us i notice these other lights on the field behind us sparkles of gold light as if we were at a airport landstrip .it became eerily hypnotic as waves were crashing up againt the bulkhead of a old dock  a rythmic sound ... next there were head lamps of cars ( it appeared to me that way) under the water of the bay.  Not just one but several meaning like 6 or seven even across the bay on the beach on the other side by the yacht club headlamps swirling around  we watched for this time in total awe  my friend her name is Violet turned to me and started kissing me and the Christmas tree  light thing starting moving towards us across the water, it became statiined right over our heads a blinding white beamed out of it and sent probing fingers down the left side of my body down the right side of violets body. It was rather electrifying  but nit deadly like  all i could say under my breath was'Oh my fucking God!!  At that moment not a second later the light turned off.  It appeared to be 10 in diameter a solid blackish bronze ball.  Hovered for a second  then zipped 5 feet up to the right .hovered stand still All the other light phenomena  then ceased  Then the black steel looking ball zoomed in a second out of sight."

What I found to be unsettling: dark smoke color, no navigational lights, no sound at all - mid-low altitude, no more than 10,000 feet in altitude.  Speed was alarming as it took 5-7 seconds to cover the direct route.  The shape was nothing I have seen.  It was not a flying wing.

It was so shiny silver and reflective and it wasn't a plane and within maybe 15 to 20 seconds of observing this my son says look look did you see that and this thing in the sky shot up at not quite at 90 degree angle maybe 80 degrees and disappeared.  There were no clouds in the sky...it was a blue sky and it was just gone and within another 20 sec we were parked at the restaurant and we were looking everywhere to see if it was a plane where would it have gone if it was a helicopter but it was nothing like that.  It was almost as if it saw us watching it and it just shot up and disappeared. it was definitely something that I could not identify there was no sound I put my window down in the car and the fact that it was just gone within seconds of looking at it was unbelievable.  it wasn't long like a plane.

The cylinder shaped object came from my right side, up in the sky slowly descending till it was a low enough to see very clearly.  I noticed it because the object was rotating as it was moving slowly.  The flying object was cylindrical in shape, kind of like the things at the bank u put your stuff in then it gets sucked up.  It had lights around it like dots, green dot, white dot, red dot, the lights outlined the object and the lights around the top of cylinder spun in circle as the object rotated (if on a clock 11-5) I looked up and pointed it out to my boyfriend as the object hovered over me for a moment while rotating.  A few people over by the house a in front of me also looked up because I was pointing up telling my boyfriend to look.  The object started moving again still going to the left of me but also rising.

3029,8/19/19 22:00,Alpine,TX,Other,"On Monday, August 19th, at somewhere around 10:00 pm in Alpine, Texas.  Me and two friends had stepped outside for a cigarette.  As we normally do we layed on our backs and admired the night sky as there is very little light pollution where we're from.  Me and one of my friends both at the same time verbally exclaimed at something we were seeing.  It appears to be an almost bird-like crescent shaped object moving through the sky.  It was invisible but we could still see it.  It was almost, cartoonishly invisible as the outline of it was pronounced but the inside of the object was invisible.  It seemed almost as if it was like a magnifying glass, warping the view of the stars above it as it traveled.  It was completely dead silent. I'm unable to determine what it's elevation was.  I saw it for 5-7 seconds, then lost track of it when I stood up to see it better.  My friend claims to have seen it continue flying then dissapear into the horizon.  Had my friend not seen it.  I'm almost certain that I would have dismissed it.  But now I'm inclined to believe that it was some sort of flying object.  Whether it was government technology or an alien spacecraft,  I am unaware.  All I know is that I did see it."

And even had I not been charging it, it would not have died watching TV for only an hour and 45 minutes.  Even if it had died, how could it be charging suddenly?  I had an uneasy feeling like I had missed time. I have a guy feeling that I was abducted and grabbed my phone just as they took me.  They had me long enough my phone died.

Not lime drones were it sounds like a card in bike spokes.  But when we firrs observed it was so slow lime a hault but when it finally came directly ovwr head torwards Indianapolis.  It was moving at a slow pace.  Just under the close but over the trees. So we conversed dor a few then realized here comes another then it reared around then got back on the same path.this happend 3 times. Now yoi can hear a airline way up in the air so small. These were not as big as a commercial airline but not private jet small. Then we realizex there were two more maybe 10 miles apart in the distance fading i. And out of clouds. Then the last one we caught maybe w minutes but it had 3 very bright white lights flashing threw its center. Now im aware it was not a ""triangle ship""  thers was a jet like atreamline to it.

That's when my son saw a blackout shapes that he could not describe after the light went out, after that it was behind us and then we never saw the light again. I drive that road everyday. There were no trees because it was where a corn field is it didn't make any sound at all what the light was very bright and big. There are new towers around if it was a drone there's no way it could flash a light that free plus I probably would have heard it ! and it was a plain I definitely would have heard it and I can't see a plane flashing a bright light and having no other lights that low and coming out us at that speed.  That's all I can really say about it.  When it passed us it flashed once more and we didn't see it again. and we don't know what it was or what it could be we talked it over and you can't come up with any explanation.  He's very strange and neither of us ever saw anything like it.  What was really confusing is that it didn't make any sounds and it was coming out of so fast and then just disappeared after I passed us, this helps you I hope so otherwise that's it that's what we saw"

The object made a quick bank to the right almost completely horizontally, and then back to the left before altering it's original course.  Why would a plane or helicopter change course and have no blinking lights and make no sound?  If I were a pilot i would go straight to my destination, not bank to the right, then the left, then alter my course, it makes no sense."

3653,7/13/19 23:00,Chapmanville,WV,Disk,Hello I’m from logan county west virginia.  The sighting occurred on july 13th of 2019.  It was a very pretty night out as my girlfriend and I Were outside just hangout on the swing. I was showing her the constellations and where they where located.  As I went to point out what I thought was the international space station we noticed a very fast moving object .As we are watching this object it zipped behind a mountain an we thought that was that. Well was I wrong next thing we know we hear like a firecracker wick burning sound and as quick as I could blink this craft what was a oval saucer with a rotating light underneath it is setting right in front of us about 100 Feet in the air.  As this craft shot in front of us it knocked the power our from everyone around us.  The whole 3 minutes it sat and what seemed like observing us we are looking in amazement knowing what we are witnessing is a UFO.  Well we hear the wick sound again then a super loud boom it takes off gliding like a well thrown paper airplane no other sound than the wick burning and loud boom did it ever make as it leaves the area we were in the power was ! restored in the instant it took off .  Well we are at the local Walmart about july 28th and a security guard who works there actually overheard us telling some friends about it and interrupted us and ask when this was we said about the beginning of the month she said  I bet that it was the same one that knock our power and backup generator out on july 13th annd I’m being completely honest the women had a picture of the exact craft we had seen the exact day we seen it plus the Walmart is only 3 miles away from where we were.  I’d like to speak vocally with someone ad I can describe it better in that way than writing it like this .  Thank you for your time.

I sat on my porch and observed the scattered fireworks crackle in the sky.  However, unlike the expected movement of light with any firework (a ball of light going up, reaction/crackle in the sky, slowly trickles down) I saw something that moved very differently.  What I saw was a small red or orange circle going up in the sky at a 45° angle (or at a slope) extremely fast.  Mind you this sighting was a few seconds, but as this ball of light continued to travel it suddenly stops and a flash of light appears or opens up in the sky.  As the flash of light was about to close or disappear the light (or ball of light I don’t know at this point) continued its straight path and also disappears.  There was no sound, just a visual, and again this was a few seconds.  The closest thing I can use as an example would be a reference to the light speed scene in Star Wars The Last Jedi - Holdos Sacrifice."

I thought it was an illusion but it stopped moving.  Then it turned red and came back the opposite direction.  Then it stopped and went back and then went back again.  It was not an airplane or helicopter. It moved very fast and turned in 360 degree angles and then it went down behind the trees.  What is odd is that it was extremely far away then close then far then when it went straight down it was close enough to look like it was less than 10 miles away.

The light went out and turned back on in a different spot. The flashes were several seconds apart and did not have a pattern. It was behind trees for about 2 flashes. The next flash it had moved quite a bit from left to right. The next flash it had gone back to the left but a different area of sky. The next two flashes is when my wife also noticed it and it moved from left to right with each flash but again had moved quite a bit of distance. The next flash it was back behind the trees all the way to the left close to where the 9 year old first noticed it. The next time it went off it was gone. The light did move while it was 'on' but was slow moving. When it went 'off' and turned back on it had moved extremely far compared to when the light was 'on'. Minute or so later we did see a plane come by and could see the significant difference between the plane lights and the one we had just witnessed.

It was traveling fairly slow and then would disappear. At this point we all are watching. When in would go out of sight to the East it wouldreappear in the West. This is when we realized it was 2 flying almost on a loop and appeared to be surveying. This lasted about 10 minutes maybe longer.

4151,6/18/19 00:00,Cumming,GA,Unknown,"Back on June 18 My friend and I at my house alone in Cumming , Ga Experienced a alien encounter and abduction. The 2 weeks prior to this event I had the feeling at my house which I live in alone with my dog and cat, that I was always being watched could and could never seem to catch the shadows/figures that seemed to be everywhere but no where in my house outside when I’d go look for something. I’d catch black figures and slight Shadows outside my windows in bushes. I’d see a white orbs floating around that were very clearly different from the fireflys out I’d see a white light floating behind one of roses Bushes. That night I had gone to the rest room my friend had let my dog off the back porch where she chased something that wasn’t there she proceeded to chase it til the start of the small section of woods that I had seen other Shadows had disappeared into.  When I walked out the door I heard my dog growling at something that neither of us could see at that moment my friend! looked over at me and said you have aliens walking down to her she had all the hair standing up on her body and when I gave the command to go track or find what ever. Peering into the woods not seeing my dog or anything we heard a shuffle in the fallen leaves then what seemed to be a high pitch screech high and louder than a jet engine would sound. After we went inside and tried just watching some tv and hang out from then on it sounded like little pebbles or something was tapping the side of my house and windows.  About 30 minutes later I went on my back porch to put some clothes in the dryer while in the laundry room my friend standing on the back deck starts insisting we need to get inside now seeing floating orbs floating around and a distant figure standing on the edge of the woods only being able to see its shape. We proceed to inside and from there it got even worse. My friend got the vibe and feeling that he didn’t wanna sleep on my couch. So I let him crash in my b! ed with me after turning out the lights and tv the whole house! seeming ly started vibrating the sounds of things hitting off my house became more intense the glasses in the kitchen vibrating we can both hear them in the cabinet. Sounds of languages and conversations that we could not understand start happening. Bumps and bangs in the back of my house where nothing was on and locked off from my animals through the night. My dog laying in bed with us seemed to start to growl then just stop like something calmed her. My cat popped in for a second said hi instead of sleeping on his bed in my room he left. After that I tried to sleep and my friend said he was going to try and mediate after that I can slighty remember not being able to move and a white light peering through my closed eyelids. The flickering of figures filling in around until at the same time me and my friend both popped up and when the lights came on we both had looks of sensory overload like someone just hit a reset on our Brains both in a what the fuck just happened look we tried t! o go to sleep with the lights on where the same thing happened. Until we both arose again at the same time looked at each other and said we need to get the fuck out now. Backing out of my driveway we both seemingly picked out a figure with some sort of owlish face standing in the woods. We left the house for the night. My friend went to a person who is open about this sort of things she took him to a spiritual cleanser she heard the story and said that it was out of her league. After meeting up the day after we both seemed to have IV prick marks on our arms in the same locations. Bruises and scratches and he had a mark on his side that looks like a medical device poked implanted something. Just seeing what the community has to say or what might be recommended."

As I scanned the sky, I saw a very long straight line of what appeared to be randomly connected lights.  Whatever this was wa incredibly long.  It seemed to be high in the sky, but I have no way to know its altitude.  I actually thought it could have been a mile or more in length.  But, if it was lower than it seemed, it would still have to be a few hundred feet in length. It moved what seemed to be slowly, but I really have no idea since this would depend on how high or low it actually was.  It was almost above me when I first saw it and I watched it continue in the same direction in what seemed to be a straight path.  I watched until it disappeared.  If it was 1 light, I would have assumed it was a satellite.  Unfortunately, I did not CV count the lights, but I estimate around 10 lights randomly spaced.  I have seen 2 other very unusual things in the night sky over the years, but this was by far the most unusual."

It was just real slow and silent.  And it was in one position for a little while and then it went off completely, and then it was in a different position in another location just probably several feet from that one, and it was not running in a straight line.  And then it turn completely off for a bit, and then it showed back up again completely in another location & the lights kept doing that same thing.  And then they all went off again. And we didn't see it again after that.  And we walked back over to the house.  Not sure what we saw, but it was definitely not an airplane, because he was moving in an erratic pattern.

Im relating the speed of the craft to multables of the usual planes that fly over head daily .  actualy every 15 min to land.  So they move at about 180 mph this moved so fast.  I cant explain of compare it to a plane.  2 maybe 3 seconds it was in space.  Ok thats it.  Unbelievable.

Would shine bright white and go back to flashing red.  This time it started to get further away.  I happened to have my flashlight on me and I started flashing it in it's direction.  It then went white and stayed white and came out in plain view to me. It's night and there was no way of making out the shape but I felt like it gave me the time of day for about 10 seconds.  It turned green and red then descended in a very dark red out of my line of sight.  I'm 35 and this is my first official s! ighting.  I've been waiting a long time for a moment like this.

The first on was about twice as bright as Venus.  The second once about three times the brightness of Venus.  I used my space app and ruled out planets.

I thought it was a plane at first but the white lights I saw started doing independent maneuvers from each other so it couldn't be a plane.  It looked like they were dancing together across the sky in kind of a snake-like configuration.  I asked my boyfriend if he was seeing what I was seeing but by that time the lights had been obscured by neighboring trees.

I estimated it to be approximately 15 miles away and approximately 20,000 feet AGL.  I realized the object I was seeing was not moving. I have 22 years in the us air force, and have over 2000 hours flying on helicopters, so I initially thought I was seeing something hoovering, and possibly something from the nearby Tyndall AFB.  I began taking photos of it and a short video.  The pictures are a sequential series of about 100 photos and show the object to have a lot of movement but it is not going anywhere.  I used a zoom lens on a new a6000 sony and did not check the photos at the time.  Later when I downloaded them to my laptop I realized I had captured some very extraordinary pictures of something I had never seen before.  Over the course of the two hours I t! ook photos the object appears to be an advanced aircraft with straight lines and horizontal stabilizers, to a rocket shaped object traveling at a very high speed, what appears to be concentric rings of a contrail, and finally what appears to be a huge luminescent stingray or butterfly with straight line edged wings on both sides."

Apache and Durango,  The Lakes Business Park   So I was watching the moon and noticed hey the moon doesnt look right with this warping quality.  The moon appeared to be peeling and shimmering at the edges sort of like how hot blacktop distorts what you see with the heat convection, but in a way that made me uneasy.  So I thought hey maybe I should see if my camphone can capture what I was seeing.  I zoomed all the way in and aimed the camera and found a steady position and this took around 30 seconds to prepare.  Video quality was junk because my phone wasnt created for long distance zoom but I pressed record anyways.  The only object in the clear sky that I could see with my camera up to that point was the moon, but as soon as I pressed record, literally within milliseconds of activating the record function, this tiny white dot appeared traversing in front of the moon.  I held my steady position suddenly full of excitement that this could be a UFO.  I couldnt actually see it with my eyes but the camera picked it up fine.  This thing is obviously high altitude.  At first I thought it was a huge coincidence that I basically got ready to film a UFO without knowing it.  Sent me for a loop.  Distance was very difficult to determine but whatever it was it was definitely very high altitude.  Difficult to not think it was actually at the moon itself, but if it were at the moon it would need to be exceptionally bright and large to shine through the daytime blue sky. UFO?  Plane?  The ISS?

It was a new moon and the stars were very bright.  The light anomaly was a soft grey/silver color and looked like a trail left by an airplane, except the movement was in a sideways direction.  The light didn't measure across the whole sky either, so as I turned around, I could still see it in my peripheral vision.  It slowly crept across the sky for about 5 minutes and disappeared.  A second one happened about 5 minutes later, in a different position, moving a different direction."

The National Park Service (NPS) prohibits flying drones at the Hatteras National Seashore, and given the fact that the NPS offices were directly below where the object was observed, I took interest in continuing to watch the object,  The object emitted no sound, and became larger over a period of 2-3 minutes and kept circling the Hatteras Lighthouse.  As it became more defined, either becoming larger, or from coming closer to the Lighthouse as a reference point, the object became well defined in shape.   The object completely resembled a 20 foot ocean container hovering approximately 200 feet in altitude and had no visible signs of propulsion or aerodynamic surfaces, just a rectangular dark box and made no sound.  The object slowly hovered and circled the Lighthouse for 2-3 minutes then slowly moved Northeast and disappeared."

I did not think it was a shooting start because it was closer than I had ever seen one before and it did not leave the bright trail of light  behind it ....at first.  Seeing it at first I thought it was an airplane and was concerned at tithe fact that it seemed to be traveling much faster than any plane I had seen, so my next thought was that it might be in trouble and perhaps going to crash.  After a few more seconds I observed the light produce two more smaller lights that seemed to break of or fall of the original one.  The two lights each went off in different directions then disappeared soon after.  The original larger white light began changing color from a blue green hue to almost all green and gave off a flickering or kind of flashing light display and seemed to be sl! owly of fading (or what I’d picture sputtering to look like), still heading north it seemed to descend as it sputtered out and soon disappeared.  Once it had began changing color from the white to the green and gave off a lighter green aura around it   I noticed it had also started to produce a trail of light behind it, just like I’ve always seen accompanying shooting stars but much more colorful, brighter, and larger than any I’ve seen before.  Could very well be a shooting star or many other perfectly normal explanation for it but I thought I’d post in the case that it’s  not."

If I were to take an educated guess I would say it was maybe half a mile away and only a few hundred feet up. It was at first just hovering there. I noticed the lights were solid, no blinking or flashing. I can only describe it as a grid like elongated rectangle with multiple squares in it. The squares were red and blue and no apparent pattern. It was disk like in shape and very dark. We were in disbelief. It then started moving eastward. The pulsating hum stopped when it started moving. It wasn't moving very fast but very steady in direction. I lost sight of it as it flew over the houses. I am in the military and I have neve! r seen any aircraft like it. We didn't know what to think after it flew away. I couldn't sleep, I tossed and turned all night. Today while at work I kept thinking I had to tell someone about this.

It is a much brighter red on the rim and a lighter red on the inside, the smaller one is to low to really see what it is doing.  The pattern would be very bright foe 5 seconds and then dim.  The pattern then changed to bright red staying longer,[approx [4] min by watch.as i write this the vibration had stopped after 5 to 10 seconds and nothing since. we are going back out to see if it is still there.  This cannot be a plane or a tower light we can see that also [the tower light] it is very large and seems quite low.with our cell phones we can actually see it turning shapes like a worm for lack of a better word.  It stays in that unformed way twisting and seems circular but not solid.after approx 5 min its then glows into a huge red mass pulsating approx 3x and then goes into a unformed weird worm movement,yet you can see in the video it looks fluid not solid.

Its worth mentioning in this part of Cranston it is one of the highest points in the entire state also has VERY heavy air traffic.  Now for what ever reason this plane keeps my attention, ill take it to my grave that this damn.  Thing looked like it wasnt moving?  And it most certainly WAS-NOT.  this huge plane which looked like a typical common large boeing was seeminly STUCK completely still in the sky!  I was heading north and the plane seemed to be heading south.  I could make out the side of the plane and the belly.  It was a large purple plane with a yellow stripe going down the middle, towards the end of the stripe it turned red and ends at a sharp point, i do not remember any writing or logos as my brain was melting.  I noticed my breathing was picking up and i found my self on my knees looking out the back window (i always sit in the rear passenger seat in ubers) im a grown man who had a grown man driving me, im sure i came off odd because the man eventually noticed me and awkwardly asked ""lots of good sights round here huh?..."" I didnt even reply as i couldn't wrap my mind around what i had just saw. I remember i desperately wanted to scream LOOK LOOK! or ask him to pull over but while im wathcing this i couldnt get anything out.  It may have been becaude this man was a stranger and i didnt wanna look insane or because i was in shock and or amazement. For those in the area the whole thing happened above the Dennys next to garden city.  The whole thing was seemingly harmless but ive been replaying it in my head over and over, i have googled it and some people have claimed to have captured exactly what i described on camera and its very eerie.  Its also propably unrelated but one thing i have found very odd is that ever since that day i have been having some very out of the ordinary good luck.!  Very minor things like finding 20 bucks, being gifted things, finding things, small coincidences that usually wouldn't go my way.  The weather was fine, nothing to note.  Very eerie and mind blowing, i WISH i could go back to that moment"

It was a very strange star because it had 2red beans one at the top one the bottom.  It was very still has no movement and it was not flickering like a normal star.  It was very stationary for about 30 minutes before we lost inside to carry on our daily life.  About 15 minutes later as we walk back outside smoke a cigarette we saw that good white head disappeared but the other stars that were next to it are still in the same position.  It is very bizarre for a non flickering star to disappear like that especially one with 2redbeans from top and bottom.  This is not the first time that I have seen something like this in my lifetime.  But it has been a very long time since I have witnessed something this extraordinary happen.

On January 10th 2019 then again in March 19th 2019. Then a few more with 3 helicopters following it south from salem. During these times we also had earthquakes at the the coast the helicopters heading South from location of pic. I have more of these pics different times dates.

We saw a hovering fireball thing thing in the sky... we first thought a drone but it seemed like it was very far away and then it moved all over simultaneously.  It seemed to ""jump and drop"" in mid air.  Dare I say I felt it was watching over us."

Upon looking up about 60° south I saw 6 red/orangish lights.  3 vividly bright.  They rather hovered, but moved slowly.  The lighting in the parking lot made it hard to decipher my surroundings.  "

6249,1/1/19 00:03,Sarasota,FL,Egg,"I was sitting outside with my mother and girlfriend on New Year’s Eve night.  My mom kept saying my name and I was ignoring her because I thought she was trying to joke or tell me a story of something when I was a kid.  After the fourth time of her calling me, I said, what ma!  She said look in the sky its a UFO.  My eyes shot straight to where she was pointing.  Just over our head 4 egg shape but more oval with Scot almost see through edges and sides flew over the top of us.  Quiet, soft, kinda like it was exposed to my eyes by it capturing the moon lite on the craft.  They had a soft dim glow to each one.  Tinted light green soft greenish yellow.  They flew soft steady, quiet, nothing like I have ever seen.  I was in the marine cops I know military craft I know noises of propulsion.  This was quiet, like an ice skater gliding on a rink of ice.  The most amazing awe mind shock I’ve ever witnessed.  Amazing moment.  I hope others come forward with this.  It was so close just wow."
