Watched with my dad as they very very slowly moved east until they were gone.  Not very dramatic but I am certain they weren't planes..  Definitely not stars..

217,12/6/18 18:15,Omer/Standish,MI,Fireball,"December 6, 2018 “Orbs” Sighting  Northern Michigan Arenac County - On the day of December 6, 2018, at approximately 6:15pm - I was headed northbound on State Rd. having left pinconning.  I had stopped at the Worth rd intersection taking notice of the recent additions to the local casino to my right... the new building stood out.  Headed north again I went about a mile or so before catching a glimpse of a amber/orange colored light. - now before I go on, I’ll note that I’ve been hyper aware of the existence of these orbs since my sighting in 2016, so I’ll admit that I stop the car and examine the sky and rule out many anomalies before jumping to the UFO conclusion...  that being said, I’ll continue - mind you, I’m trying to split my attention between driving and watching this amber/orange light. I keep catching the the activity of this light and realize that it’s more than one light.  At one point there was at least for to five, and the movements between them varied... one would be somewhat still, the others kind a random, but different almost swirling to swarming... they would dim and un-dim and randomly “dance like fireflies” - they remind me of fireflies! - Like how a firefly can be right there in front of you and go out in a moment, just disappearing into the black of night.  This is very much like a sighting two years ago on December 13, which was also during the full moon of that month and year - we had four strange moon events in ‘16 - this was I believe on the fourth of those.  On that event, my mother and I witnessed “orbs” above Hale, MI. - as soon as I realized I was seeing a similar event I called my mom who had been with me during the previous sighting to let her know I was seeing them again.  (This was at 6:18pm according to my phone log) I was letting her know I was hoping to get to a spot where I could get out and get some video.  On our previous sighting, the orbs were hard to catch on the iPhone but did get two brief vids before the battery died from the cold air - this time, as I was taking to my mom about trying to get a video and looking for a spot to pull of the road...  all the activity slowed. I got off the phone and kept a close eye on the spot where they had been.  Unfortunately I did not get an opportunity to get photos or videos.  The thought had crossed my mind that other cars/drivers were seeing something similar as we all seemed to be slowing, even the cars heading opposite my direction.  I had hoped that I’d get a closer look as I was headed toward the city of Omer, where these objects seemed to be located above.  This sighting marks the second definitive “orb” sighting for me, and the third object sighting here in northern Michigan that I’d label without question a UFO"

The view from my camera phone showed the object bouncing up and down and left and right sort of in the same area though.  I took about 10 or 15 pictures.  Then I zoomed in with my camera and begin to make a video.  It was changing colors from blue to green to Yellow to Orange.  It seems to have a distinct Ring around The edge with a few spiky shaped things coming around the outside edge.  Maybe three of them?  It started shooting way up high and down low in all directions to the left and the right all corners of my camera screen blinking and changing colors all the while.  Towards the end it was zipping back and forth so fast it seems to split off in two or three different crafts.  But I believe it was just the speed of the object that made it appear that way. It never did disappear the only reason I left is because the person that was ! with me insisted on going.  I would have stayed there forever.  I zoomed in on some of the still shots that I took later on.  Amazing!  I swear it seem to be a being in there with big dark eyes a little skinny neck and a greenish colored head.  If you zoom in on some of the steel shots you'll see what I'm speaking of.  It is the most amazing beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life!  I would have stayed there all night until it went away if I had an option.

I started to think I was crazy because every single one would move in any direction the either disappear into another light in the general area or it would break apart into either one or even up to 5 different color balls of light. Then each ball of light would dance around each other at random distances and come back together I to one light. Every few minutes at a random area in the sky these balls of light would flash a light towards another ball of light. It’s amazing the whole sky is covered with moving star like objects that move around random directions starting at one ball of light and break up int a number of different options this has been going on for hours.

I failed to get my view of what I believe to two flying objects almost colliding.  One was a fighter jet and the other was an unfamiliar craft traveling at a high rate of speed.  My logical answer would be a possible drone photoshoot of a fighter jet? That still does explain the speed difference between the two.  The jet looked sluggish and slow in comparison.  If there was a near miss mid air collision, there should be a report.  It may be nothing,  I'm not experienced enough to identify the object in the picture and/or video."
365,11/17/18 16:25,Chambersburg,PA,Teardrop,On November 17th 2018 witnessed what we believe is a jet fighter almost colliding with a UFO.  I email the picture of the before close call and a video of after.  I missed the close contact shot.  The jet was easily identified by its contrails.  It was traveling East to West.  The UFO was in the port side of the jet coming from the South heading North.  I'm not experienced enough to identify the other flying craft.  It did fly at a higher rate of speed compared to the jet.  The craft also seemed to fly funny.  Almost like a studded before a burst of acceleration.  It's possible that the flying object was part of a training exercise.  The UFO made the jet look sluggish and rugged in comparison.

After awhile they broke into 6 per group and came together with 5 of the six forming a U shape with 6th one in the middle, after hours of observing the orbs they all broke formation and lined up individualy in single file from one end of the sky to the other like if it was roll call as the lone orbe came over and after a few minutes some went back in to Triangle formations while others broke into pairs and zipped through the sky like if they were rubber balls jerking left right up and down like a streak of speed.  I noticed several falling stars throughout the ! night and also noticed when air craft pass by they dim out and as they pass get bright again.  We observed alot of unexplained events the entire night such as 3 bodies standing in the road visual only to the video camera but could not see them in plain view.  The middle one was about 8ft tall like a floating shadow with two shorter being standing on each side in white clothing just standing there then i noticed the video didnt save but started recording again and caught them moving across the ground in a blue color haze to the left of us.  Then seen what seemed bright head lights coming of the hill side coming straight for my uncle and i, we had atleast 20 sec to discuss who it could be clear out here, maybe fish and game, maybe rancher, spot lighter, or bird hunter when it got about 20 yards away it turned the lights off and i instintly grabbed my head light switch turning on my lights but didn't see any road off the steep rough mountain side and there was no vehicle to be seen.  I think i dosed off about 3:30am to awaking to my uncle telling me he's been watching these headlights behind us about 300 yrds away and said it looked like the head lights were traveling on a road going up and down but not bouncing.  I said show me were and drove to the location of the lights and observed a structure that was built outta twigs and woven together that resembled a hound dog with a tail and had u branch straight through it coming up above the structure looked like something outta dr suess book.  It stood in resemblance of a igloo stood about 4 1/2 feet and as long as 12ft i have video and pictures of the events theres much more but im burnt on typing lol sorry.  I have spent 6 days and nights observing them in day and night and always know when things are getting real because clouds start forming like a small storms arising but clouds look like faces...weird i know but we asked two other individuals to join one night and didnt mension why and then one girl screams omg do you see that omg omg what is it and looking up seen 2 li! ghts plnwheeling around a brighter one inside.

I took my dog for a walk and at the end of our sub-division is a side walk area located on Farmhouse Rd.  I was thinking in my head (there are no chemtrails in the sky and it would be a perfect opportunity to physically see a UFO) as strange as it sounds I am being 100% serious.  The second these thoughts were going on in my head a Big ball of light emerged up in the sky (at first I started thinking holy cow) and then I was ruling out everything because it did not streak across the sky, it did not flash or move, it just appeared for about 4-5 seconds way up in the sky and then poof it was no longer there.  I did experience static electricity throughout my entire body and immediately called my spouse who was at home.  I do feel as if something intelligent heard my thoughts--at least this is how I felt.  This was a fascinating experience and I hope to communicate more and see results (hopefully film it)."

They were somewhat above a football field where an event was taking place and an air show was scheduled the following day at a near by airport.  We chalked it up to the air show or the event at the field at the time but I was watching a tv show today that had very similar objects.  They were like fireballs but not exactly.  They had a trail that followed them when they moved but then they would move and stop and become round again.  At first they seemed to be something falling like a meteor but stopped and hovered or moved side to side.  One split into several different balls.  I have 2 videos which I will send.  I posted the videos on Facebook and an ex military friend of mine said it was the air rangers from the show practice jumping so we never thought anything else about it until I just saw the TV show with the same balls we saw, so I decided to report it just so someone else could take a look because I’m not so sure.

When I noticed it wasn't moving but 8t light beams were, I looked around to see if anyone else was seeing what I was seeing.  A familiar fella in the neighborhood seen it along with myself and I belief a person at a bar located across from Walgreens also stepped to the street whereas there was a perfect view without building obstacles.  IT appeared to be possibly a get drop but square more like an exclamation mark, or 1/2 how turned to the side, the lights were very bright.  When I first noticed it and compared to the air traffic in the skies, it as evident this wasn't a drone, not an airplane, and superman I heard is on vacation right now.  The lights went from 3 white beams pointed down, gradually opened to a 5 pt beautiful Star like  shape, trust me, I began praying, I thought perhaps the Bethlehem star, it was huge and beautiful,  then the 5 pts came back to 3 beams again but pointed upward now then quickly went to 2 beams still pointing upward before it went wooosh, vanished in thing air and appeared as if ashes were falling from sky where it had been.  there was a lot of air traffic, theres gotta be someone up there in an aircraft who seen it also.  I sure hope im not the only one reporting this incident."

725,10/7/18 19:22,Long Beach,CA,Light,"I walked out of Trader Joe's to the parking lot and saw at least a dozen people pointing up to the sky; pointing and gasping looking due north toward/above Palos Verdes from Long Beach.  I have never made any such report before but this was truly a strange event.  The sky was cloudless but for only a few miles square in this northern part of the sky; and in the middle of this ""clearing"" there was a large spotlight- like a flashlight around 1/2 the size of the moon shining eastward.  The power of this perfectly focused and precise light was extremely intense and appeared to cover at least 50 miles shining parallel to the ground at, and I'm guessing of course, a height of around 20,000 feet?  This enormous spotlight/flashlight was not moving whatsoever; it was transfixed in the night sky.  Witnesses were absolutely freaked out, and although I am not too excited about much of anything, I will admit that this was quite creepy and without obvious, logic! al explanation.  My 9 yr old daughter will not stop talking about it.  We took photos. It lasted full strength for around 20 minutes and then abruptly tapered off, and close shut, in around 15 seconds.  Then all the witnesses started talking together, comparing notes, trying to figure out what we'd seen.  It was a professional crowd and yes there was some anxiety among everyone.  I cannot find a single report anywhere of this event but then again I am not part of the UFO community."

That night one flew from due north over the house at a high rate of speed, it then abruptly changed direction without losing speed on a 45 degree angle to due east, then disappeared.  I’ve been spooked since. When I went out and looked the following day, at first I didn’ see anything.  The front of my house faces due south, so when I looked up to the southeast, i could see Orion, i’ve Always enjoyed Orion.  After a time, I saw what at first I thought was a star, however I saw that it was moving and appeared to be changing colors from reddish orange to a blue green color.  It looked like it was pulsating, and it would fade in and out. Some of the fading was due to a thin layer of clouds.  I then went into the house to retrieve my iphone6s to record it. I recorded 20 minutes.  When I replayed the video and zoomed in, I realized that it was 2 discs flying in conjunction.  It appears it's possible other craft came into the picture as well.  I don’t know for sure.  I watched for as long as possible, but eventually the cloud cover became too thick.  I don’t know what they are, however if you want the video footage, you are welcome to it."

The sky was black with a couple of low thinn clouds passing slowly.  It was exactly 8 o clock when we went outside to smoke.  I happen to look up in the sky and saw what appeared to be a golden bright star moving like an airplane in the sky to left and slightly above the Orion constellation.  I didn't think much of it until another light quickly caught up to the 1st out of nowhere at a speed and rate of acceleration and sudden deceleration that no aircraft could do this.  Both stopped for several minutes and began to follow each other in a circle shape.  They seemed to disappear after a while behind some clouds.  Several minutes later we saw several other lights zooming about in the same area eventually seeing 6 at once.  Some of them stayed still and would move slowly and only a small distance while others seem to bobble and play around in an almost childlike way.  One was stationary and it seemed to split into two separate lights.  One of them sped  away faster than my eye could follow.  Some of them would glow really bright and then dim in un related intrivels as they accelerate very quickly.  Eventually they seemed to dim or move up in altitude one by one until I could no longer see them anymore.  I didn't see anymore but an hour so later noticed a giant streak of light like a shooting star toward the north.  I seen an abnormally high amount of what looked like normal aircraft with flashing red lights moving in all directions through out the experience.  It was a very strange night I will never forget.

After several moments of concerted effort studying parts of the sky, I was ready to leave, but for some reason I had an urge to look one more time and that is when I saw a peculiar object. The way my eyes focused on it, I could not very well tell if it was a small craft close to me or a large craft that I was seeing perhaps 30,000 feet distance. The object was a white triangle traveling in a spiral path away from me.  The speed of the rotation and forward movement was very fast and I remember thinking that a human pilot would not be able to withstand the force. As I watched it, I could tell that something seemed! to be struggling to pilot the craft because it was making very quick corrections and not moving in a smooth or straight line. Because of the speed and color, I lost it in the sky for a moment but then again found it before it moved out of my eyesight range. The craft made no sound and there were no lights nor trail of exhaust. Means of propulsion seemed otherworldly and unsuitable for Earth's atmosphere and gravitational forces."

As the sun was still up mostly, it was mostly staying I would guess about three or four thousand foot altitude.  That it was clearly around disc saucer shape, and when it took off you didn't take off lightning fast it was moderately fast, but slow enough to follow visually.  Right about to the point it was out of sight, it went really fast. Whether it was bending light and appeared to go fast I would say right at the point when it was out of sight but not as it was leaving from the stationary point.  It was a classic saucer shape which I would think you wouldn't see typically during this period of time.  Developmental agreements government and otherwise but was very nice to see.

It didn't have any sound or noise coming from the aircraft. It began to move, change direction in a weird way.  That's when i knew it wasn't a helicopter by the way it was flying and how the lights were flashing and look.  I took my phone out and began recording it.  Other people that were driving their cars noticed it as well by the way they were hitting the break.  I turned on a road not far from my house. Stop the car and kept recording it.  I began to drive again, as i was driving the aircraft started flying in the direction I was going.  I thought it was following me.  I got a little nervous and stop recording and picked up speed to get home.  As I was telling my fiance what I saw I was getting the video ready to show her.

Due to hacking of my computer I was unable to upload this video to my new phone so I recorded the original recording on a new phone.  When I viewed the video an image appeared in the video.  The image looks alien and is a face that is not human looking.  The image has a mouth that looks human.  The eyes do not.  I have tried to find out how this image showed up.  I used a phone to record this video from my laptop and was in my home.  Again the video I was recording was a video I had taken outside of the birds and was in my yard.  I had uploaded it to my laptop.  This video was taken from a different phone so I wanted to record it on my phone.  I have tested what I did when recording and I am unable to reproduce this image.  I tried to copy and paste the image here but was unable to. I have had other people view this ! video and many believe it is alien form.  Some say it could be a spirit.  I can email this image to be viewed.  Thank you.

On the way to the house right after we had turned down a secluded road surrounded by trees I saw a large triangle shaped aircraft flying in the sky just above the trees.  I alerted my friends to the object and then we couldn’t see it for a second because of the angle from which we were driving and the trees because it was flying low right above the trees.  After a few more seconds we were able to see it again and then my other two friends could see it.   The object was flying low and slow paced almost as if it was flying at the same pace as the car we were in but it was big probably the size 2000 sq ft home if not bigger and there was no sound coming from it at all.  There were what appeared to be three lights close together on the edge of the craft in the middle of the side we were looking at and  appeared to be blinking lights on each corner of the side we were looking at.  We watched it for about a minute as we continued to travel to the house right when we were making a turn to get to the house we could no longer see it.

The object was very high in altitude when compared to aircraft flying overhead (compared to transient aircraft at high altitude, NOT compared to local aircraft on approach/departure from BDL approx 10 SSW of our location.  The object was first observed by myself almost due north of us, and pointed out to my wife and friend.  The object appeared to be spherical in shape however due to the brightness of the object no true discernable outline was visible.  The weather was hot and humid with slight haze.  The object was only visible while wearing sunglasses, with sunglasses off the object was unable to be seen.  It was however, bright and had an almost mirror like shine to it.  It did not appear to be moving at all in reference to nearby inanimate structures.  There were 60 to 70 foot trees approximately 100 yards in front of us, the object was roughly three hand widths above the tree line.  The intensity of the light did not fade or increase throughout the sighting.  We were actually in an amusement park ride line when it was spotted.  After completing the ride we were unable to find the object again.  About the closest thing I could compare this to would be viewing a planet such as Venus at dusk, again however it was mid-day.

Never seen such an object in the skies before.  I was able to record the phenomenon and it can be clearly seen on video.  I was able to catch the object disappear on video as well.

The triangles were shot off both sides of the flying object. It took the flying object about 5 seconds to fly out of sight. Both witnesses looked at each other in confusion and believed no one would take us seriously if we talked about it.

The flare like light to the right dissipated and had flashes of white light streaks flowing away from it until that completely dissappeared.  Then the original star like light that appeared first reappeared in the same area that we first saw it to only be blocked by some passing clouds.  The skys were clear enough to see Stars and planes.  Only a small patch of clouds obstructed our view in the end.

All remained stationary the few minutes I watched them thought of taking a photo, wish I had, but also remember having a concern that if I took a photo, it (whatever it was) might not take kindly to a photo being taken.

Then a few minutes later she said there it is again...I looked up and saw a star like light moving slow then suddenly it got VERY bright and faded away in a circular fashion and disappeared.  I will never forget it.  It was a strange night because although the sky was completely clear I kept seeing bright flashes of light that was exactly like lightning lighting up entire sky and rumble of thunder but it was clear with zero clouds.  So weird. Never rained or clouded up or anything.  Cannot explain it and I am a skeptic.  It was amazing.  After that happened I grabbed my GoPro and aimed it at the sky and set it to night time lapse. I left it all night.  I have the photos it took but I do not know how to plug the still night photos into editing software to see it in action.  It recorded for a few hours at least maybe more before battery ran out.  It will be fun to watch if I can highlight the stars...at least to see the weird flashes like lightning.

I first thought it was a satellite or low star and then reasoned it was too low and seemed to move.  I went inside and asked by skeptical husband to come and look.  He thought it was strange as well.  We ruled out helicopter and at that point I went and got my video camera with a rather large zoom.  It got stranger from there.  My husband thought it might be a drone as it would get farther from the camera and then come back closer.  However, when it did come back closer, I got very interesting video that did not look like a drone as it had many more lights; not to mention it was bigger than personal drones and I have not ever seen a military one so I can't say it wasn't.  My son came out and wanted to look and he said it looked like it was morphing.  Very strange.  We got in the car to see if we could get closer to the object and got some additional video.  We live in a mountainous region of SW Virginia so your view is often blocked by trees and low areas.  We tried to think of another high spot and went out Route 19 towards to North Fork River.  We got half way there and realized we were to low and our view was being obstructed by the hills.  When then came back into town and went up on a hill at our local Moose Club but once again trees obstructed our view until we came down the hill.  We got additional footage and after reviewing it looks like the there are many lights and they are twinkling.  We headed home and that is the last we saw of it.  The event lasted around 40 minutes.  I plan on checking with our local airport to see if they had any calls or if they can identify the object in my videos."

2014,6/19/18 02:00,Orlando,FL,Unknown,Tonight I was outside watching a gator.  And I noticed these lights behind a tree and I didn't have my glasses on so I didn't think nothing of it.  They sat there for about 5 minutes or so until something clicked in my head.  That thing's been sitting there a long time planes  Do not sit in one spot. it appeared to be closed yet the object was pretty decent size in the sky.  Relative to the tree I was looking at a few hundred yards away it appeared to be not to be much higher than the trees and guessing their relative size of a medium-sized plane. I'm voice typing.  When I realized that thing was acting odd by not moving and the shape of it was hard to explain since I have stigmatism I want know if it's correct.  Anyways when I started filming it it started to move slow and it moved behind a tree not level with the tree.  I don't know how to explain this I did video tape it but couldn't get it to clear up and show everything I was seeing. I thought maybe it was a large drone or a military crafts.  But then I read a guy named Sosa's on here and what he seen pretty much describes what I seen.  It's slowly passing the head and acted sort of like a helicopter but it didn't look like one.  I'm not really certain but I do have videotape.  I hope you guys can read this.  Maybe it's a military crafts and they're waiting to see what kind of reports they get on i   It had one bright light and then a few lights behind it that were smaller one was blinking.  I really can't explain what I seen I've not seen it before.  Because I was standing near my central air and heat I couldn't hear the motor.

I have seen these objects with them and by myself almost every night this week and almost nightly since around the 20th of April (or so).  These objects almost are somewhat triangular but almost remind me of something from Star Trek or Star Ward like a Warbird or Falcon type aerial vehicle.  HOWEVER, they seem to be hovering and only move so slightly and in a flight path unlike any regular plane I've ever heard of. Even as of last night, three to four of them are position in an almost quadrilateral type formation.  They seem to be just 'watching us'.  The objects we observe seem to give off a blue-ish hue...yet lights (flickering orange/green sometimes emanate from them).  They seem to almost react intelligently as I am wandering my yard trying to keep focused on them.  They flicker sometimes that it almost seems impossible to focus.  I have seen these thin! gs so often that any notion of considering it to be anything 'recognizable or explained away' diminishes.  My family and I also have witnessed red and green lighted low-flying aircraft in the skies on two of these occasions.  They don't seem to perceive the objects and 'they' in turn seem unaffected, as well.  It's freaky.  Has anyone else seen these?"

I was standing at my window smoking a cigarette and as I was putting it out I looked up and saw a air vehicle that I thought was a Cessna, that was entering my field of view from the left.  It was over the back of Wasilla lake when I saw it.  It moved slowly like a plane and seemed to look like a concept vehicle at over a couple thousand feet.  It had a red light you would see on the wing of a plane and an engine sound.  What I couldn’t focus on for a moment was when the engine quit running and I thought it would crash.  It was a sound effect of a plane that stopped.  It turns towards me and begins to bring the bottom of the craft upright as it’s approaching.  As this occurred, I put my hand up slowly over my heart and away in front of it.  There was one slow turn until it stopped about 40 feet in front of me.  I acted like shaking its hand and returned my hand over my heart.  As I looked it over, it was floating in front of me pointed parallel to the building I was in and not at me; it had a cross reaching all the way to the sides with no unnecessary markings except for the red light.  This red light was situated on the top part of the cross which represents intelligent action in the way it was on top since it turned towards me from the lake.  I was a few feet from my phone but I was stunned to move naturally and I had my gf sleeping in bed right next to me.  I didn’t want to wake her.  After about five minutes as it seems to be off to my right like presenting me with an award or something, it starts to leave to the left, slowly and in the same position it was in last.  Professionally, it seemed it was checking on a post nearby.  I have experience because I’m a veteran so perhaps maybe I was more valuable than the regular person.  It was excellent and exciting to witness and I had love in my heart and it made sense to me. I’m not cruel.  Nothing around it was moving, and it became stationary when it stopped.

The object remained in the sky for more that 15 minutes and so I decided to take a picture of the streak across the sky. It was to our amazement to see the bright light as the source of the “cloud” phenomenon in the picture I took with my iPhone 7. Neither my wife or I ever saw the bright light with out naked eyes; it was only in the photo that the bright source light appeared.

It looked like an enormous spotlight in the sky, heading towards us. It moved fast until it came close to us, then it moved almost in slow motion until I stopped in the middle of the road, just staring at it. I then pulled into the gas station, and was yelling at my husband to grab my phone and record . Repeatedly asking him, ""what is that""? What is that?? I could see the entire underneath of it. It was a semi- diamond shaped object. I say semi because it wasn't EXACTLY a diamond shape. Under the object there were dozens of florescent lights, ranging in color from blue, green, red, and orange lights.. Underneath there was a semi circle of lights blue and red. Around the semi circle was a shape of a diamond or square depending on the viewpoint. The lights outlining the square/diamond shap! e underneath were green and orange in color. I am a person of sound mind, but this had me completely shaken. I was screaming at my husband, and honestly thought I was going insane. Never in my life have I seen anything like this. Ever. There's not a soul in this world that can tell me, nor convince me that this was a plane. It appeared to be 8 times bigger than any plane I've ever seen in my life.

One witness felt particularly ill immediately before and following the event.  Another factor that perplexed them was that the apparent aircraft failed to produce any sound.  The craft was larger than any commercial airliner.  They immediately went home to research and look for similar stories as to what they had just encountered.

The more I watched, i noticed that it was moving, but very little.  It's altitude stayed pretty much the same but it was bouncing from side to side as if to steady.  The blue light is not star blue, rather, it appears LED.  But it is only blue, a perfect circle of blue emitted light.  For the past hour it has changed altitude and position slightly, but still in relative proximity.  My wife came out to watch and noticed yet another light within a couple of miles of the other.  Focusing in with a camera reveals that the light is luminated by what appear to be hundreds of small lights of different colors, yet primarily blue.  I have see an oval and one cone in my lifetime.  They were both hauling some serious ass.  These ones un-nerve me, because they are so stationary, in what seems a strategic distance apart.   If i could elevate myself in my current position, I fear that I would see more of them in a line.  This has been going on for an hour now, and they have yet to break position.  Pictures are unfortunately on my camera because my phone will not zoom in to that altitude..  Which says A LOT because six days ago I was able to zoom in on the FEMA cargo carrier that landed at McGee Tyson, and be able to identify it from 15,000 feet."

Then, I thought well it was a Satellite, I have seen them before moving straight across the sky, but then it curved out to the sea, and faded out.

I had to assume that possibly the changing viewing angle had something to do with shape change although at times the object(s) seemed to either be vibrating or rotating.  That object suddenly appeared and was very slowly moving towards the ocean and back nearly directly overhead just above where I live.  As I continued watching I noticed another object moving very slowly, coming directly out of the setting sun direction and moving very slowly in direct horizontal line towards the first object in what looke! d like a collision course.  The first object seemed to stop and just hover while the other approaching object drew closer.  As the two got very close the second flew past the first above it then as they got further away from each other they began to move in tandem, then going from perpendicular to a horizontal position and moved from north-west to south-east in tandem then they seemed to break off formation and slowly spread one to the west while the other seemed to more or less hold its position at about a 50-80 degree angle to my viewing position.  These objects went from a white color to sometimes a shimmering metallic or reflective mylar look but it wasn't solid looking when it began shimmering it seemed to flash as if it had multiple surfaces.

When I developed pictures, I noticed a UFO in the photo and I’ve been busy taking photos and video ever since.  RARELY do I get a day of NOTHING in my photos and videos.  I have to say in all fairness, it’s a bit of an Art finding these UFOs in a video and photo (you must be Sluthy) but once you figure it out, you know what to look for.

3356,1/8/18 08:45,Greensboro,NC,Disk,I saw lights streaking across the sky zooming down to the earth.  The streaks were bright and white.  I also so aircraft every all over as if they were looking for something.   So I took out my camera and filmed and took shots.  Later as I reviewed the photos and zoomed in I was able to see the detail of a hunched over clear figure landing a disk shaped figure.  Relative to the size of a full moon this figure appeared 4 times larger as it got closer to the surface of land.  While in the sky compared to a full size moon it was smaller than the moon and appeared to be only as 1/32 the size of the moon.  Also smaller black Dracula drooping looking figures flew across the moon and were smaller than the moon.  The crafts sort of moved like a bumble bee or a fly.  Many planes and jets were in the sky.  Smaller tear drop light figures also began appearing in the sky in a very calm smoothing upward progression.  The sky was very active.

This took place just above the Capon Springs hotel/resort. Both craft were completely illuminated in a bright yellowish white.  Both craft appeared to be about 1000 to 1500 ft apart, but were hovering at the same altitude.  There was no noise - completely silent.  We were about 10,000 to 15,000 feet away from the objects location at the local fire department.  These were not drones, aircraft (man made) unless there is a gravity defying technology that I'm unaware of.  Truly amazing!!  Never seen anything like it and I can't rationalize what these objects were.  Tried to think of every possible scientific explanation and there are none.  "

As she was doing her business, (I star gaze every night and am very aware of the stars/planes that are in my area) I noticed the skies were UNUSUALLY dark and couldn't make out a single star.  As I searched the sky for for any visible stars, I spotted an extremely bright light in the northeast, somewhat low in the horizon.  It seemed to change shapes (if that makes any sense) and blink erratically.  It was changing shape from a circle to a horizontal dumbbell-like shape and seemed to blink from yellow to a whitish like light.  At first I thought it was stationary, so I positioned myself near a tree so the branches would could be in the line of vision so I could gauge any movement. It seemed to slowly move to the east, and be at least a mile out, so I couldn't tell the size.  Then, after observing it for about 30 seconds, it just blinked out.  I walked to the backyard to see if I c! ould find it, but it was definitely gone."

Suddenly I was nude standing in what seemed to be a large cavern, in front of me was a 30 ft wide infinitely tall windowless doorless tower with a light emmting from behind the tower, the color of this light was of a hue I have never seen and therefore makes it very difficult to discribe.  I can remember the way the floor felt on my bare feet, it was cold and damp and gritty.  Then I was suddenly in my bed again and in my clothes, wide awake the entire time. My wife who was asleep noticed nothing until I woke her up by grabbing hold of her and pulling her close to me.  I have had bouts of nausea off and on since and images of extraterrestrials make me very uncomfortable now.  To the point of causing  chills and anxiety.

It was traveling slowly with no typical aircraft navigation lights.  Within very few seconds another appeared behind it in the same flight path and then another until there were five.  Then it was as if they turned away one at a time and faded away.  Within seconds 3 more appeared  from the original location. They followed a simular path and then faded away as well.  My wife and 15 year old daughter saw them as well.  This continued for around fifteen to twenty minutes.  Through binoculars they looked like just orange fire balls reflected off what looked like a white sheet. We have seen this before several years ago in Mount Vernon Washington.  I believe it is a group of people with slow aircraft of some sort just giving a show but it is very strange.
