I went upstairs and could still see it, although it had moved further west.  It was still there and ""flitting about"" 35 minutes after first sighting it."

I decide to take a picture on my cell phone and after I stood and watched the skies for a short time there after.  I never saw the object at any point it was only after going back through photos on my cell phone did I discover  that the object was there May 27 2020.

So, it's fair to say, I can quickly spot what's not supposed to be there.  The light would dim and completely disappear.  Then, it would brighten back up.  I timed the intervals, they were odd..

My son got it on Snapchat (of course) I tried to record it but I'm currently regretting my decision to keep my S8 phone.. As you can guess I barely was able to catch anything.

Then noticed a 3rd behind and realised they were in a triangle moving together.  The two in front passed one another, and I wondered if they were military craft because here in UK only military planes fly in pairs. As I looked left to right I then noticed the others.  In a line moving at the same speed, steady and equally spaced apart. Like a string of lights across the sky.  I counted 6 of them and called my husband to come and take a look.  We just watched and they kept on coming, I was counting 10 or 11 and getting excited. Tried taking video but they were so high up, like stars moving. I rang my mum to ask if she could see them on the other side of city.  They were still coming across atleast 22, we lost count, I was saying it's a fleet.  After the first fleet, we saw 2 planes flying low north to south direction, they had blue and red wing lights and flashed, definitely planes.  That's when we saw more white star like lights coming across.  Totally different, steady, spaced out, not flashing and really high up above on the same line of flight as before only fewer.  I asked my mum the time, she said 9.45PM.  We talked about what they could be, my husband was speechless and just wanted to watch.  We saw the last one at about 10.05pm.  The sky is clear, no cloud, no rain, no mist.  Stars are clear to see. All of the star lights flew West to East in a perfect line.  My house is at highest point on a hill, city and houses below my eye level.  No objects or buildings obstruct view.  Wondered if I should go on fb, or Leicester mercury?  Or police, who do you tell?  Thought maybe they're on radar at East Midlands Airport or Leicester private airport?  What do you think?  Can't believe this is happening, like is it military or what?  I wondered satellites, but at least 20 satellites?  No way.  So must be UFOs.  There must be other people who saw them, but we are on covid19 lock down.  Is that why we're on lock down!?  Is som ething else going on that no one is telling us?  Got so many questions, weird but excited.  I need to know, I want answers."

Low flying craft with no lights or sound, with very little visual indication unless you see it at the right time.  The 4 sightings were all at different elevations and different spots in the sky.

Last night it was in a slightly different area in the sky. I said ""get theres that light that i guess is a planet (laughing because I got called crazy for saying it was a if I watching the area) and i looked away for about 5 seconds after saying.this to my fiance and he said yes I see it. But as we looked back 5 seconds later we both notice it was gobe. This was very big and white light so bright youd swear it wasa planet. And then boom. Gone. As we are looking for it wondering how it just dissapeared...it came back in a very slighlty different spot to thw right. No colors flashing. It disnt really twinkle or flash. Then it got super dim amd looked like a pin for light like a no! rmal star. Then itd get brighter and dim again but more frequently but still slow enough there was no fast flash in between. Then we noticed very far away was two more but these two were grouped together and seemed to be communicating with flashes. No other colored lights. Just super white. As we looked back to the original main huge dimming light we notice it was going up and very far away to where we couldnt see it no more. It made motions the whole time that i call swimming in the sky. It loomed like the motion fish make to swim but also going up and down back and forth farther and closer.no sound associated with the craft.  After that main big one dissapeared we notice one of the others also dissapeared but the other stayed. We went inside and a few minutes later I went to look out my window and seen that the last one had gone too. I have a 49 second video. But its hard to tell. And im slightly shaky from nerves so tonight (4/19/20 i intend to set up a spot so the camer! a is steady and as it gets dark i want to see if it comes back! or more come back. Also....last night we went out again after it all and there was nothing else but the hazy fog like clouds were eerie and one spot was even squiggly like a far away galaxy would appear. Probably not related to what i seen but it added to the spook. ( we are being watched) odd time with the covid19 that sightings are increasing !  I woke up with a long scratch on my leg and its still welped like it had just happened. As soon as i opened my eyes my mind went to the pain. Creepy!"

Same place, we’ve been watching it for about 10 minutes now, I decided to take a vid, you can see a plane pass by with blinking lights, the vid is a bit blurry since the thing is so bright.  But you can see it doesn’t move & the plane does. I could be completely wrong & it could be a very bright star...I wish you all could see what we see instead of the vid, I have an iPhone XR I took the recording of. It’s still there if anyone reads this & wants to take a closer look maybe with a telescope which we don’t have."

On this night I seven or more ( seven that I counted while outside smoking a cigarette) circular lights moving across the sky. They moved at their own speed, moving slowing then a little fast then stopping Before continuing again. They did this in the West side of the sky opposite of the organ mountains in Las Cruces NM, towards the small mountainin range in the east,the hot springs I believe, they moved like that until they were under what I would consider the north star, the brightest star in the sky I can see with the dipper south of it, and as they did they brightened, then moved faster between two stars to the right exactly parallel from each other and shot bright then disappeared. I have an albino German Shepard, his name is Clifford, he was outside and howling at the time this was happening and after I stopped seeing lights and what lo! oked like ships jumping to light speed, he stopped and came and sat next to me, not moving, when usually he can't refrain from jumping on me and my wife. This happened many times.. within literal seconds of the next light. One. Two. Three, four lights and on and they moved, then got bright, then shot across the sky and disappeared.

Then i noticed 8 more behind them all same speed and distance.  Bright round light, then i noticed 3 other objects in a triangle formation behind other objects.  I kind of afraid so i called my daughters bf to look at the sky. we noticed more in a straight line behind i would say 14 - 15 objects already.  He said those are planes. I express how is that possible too many one after another and no sound.  I have heard planes flying greater heights many times before and i can clearly hear engine roaring.  This group of objects make any sound. He left but i continued to keep watching, when i notice approximately another 5 behind the 15 - 16 except 1 object flow in a different direction north west same speed. The others were going the same speed same distance apart all the same size heading from south towards north east. I started thinking they possibly maybe be satell! ites. But i started feeling scared at that point and went inside.  After 20 minutes or so i was curious if the objects were still visible.  Unfortunately the sky was brighter and could see any more lights or objects.  Hopefully others witness this event this morning.  What i did realized is the speed they all were traveling is same as plane normally except the absence of sound.  Last thoughts is why would 30 or more planes be flying in that formation??

I stepped out and looked up at the stars, as I've done for the past 9-years.  The sky was beautiful, dark and completely void of any clouds.  Suddenly, I noticed what looked like a, bright, moving orb.  It had to be, at least, 50 - 60,000 feet in the sky.  There were no flashing lights and no sound.  As I focused on it, with my eyes, it stopped moving and another object of the same shape and height moved up beside it which caused the first object to take off at an incredible speed.  I, immediately, called for my shift partner who came outside to witness the second moving object.  That's when we both began to witness a small fleet of these identical objects heading in a southeastern direction. There were at least 15 of these objects moving, slowly, across the night sky; no trails, sounds, or flashing lights. After witnessing this activity for ! at least 15 minutes, my shift  partner and I, nervously, returned inside the group home.  About 5-10 minutes later we both returned outside out of curiosity and were still able to witness a few of the same spacecraft straggling behind.  By 10PM, the sky had suddenly become increasingly cloudy which shrouded our visibility."

1075,3/30/20 20:47,Kensington,MD,Circle,"At around 8:47 pm tonight I noticed 4 perfectly aligned stars. They were to the west of Venus. Curious as to what they were, stars or planets, I finished putting out the trash, continued to stare at them and went inside to look online about them. Finding nothing, I took my camera out to try to photograph them. At 8:50 or 8:51 I was back out and there they were, but immediately began to lightly hover, the bottom two most notably. Then all four seemingly distant stars started to move at perfectly measured intervals from each other. The bottom two performed a strange half circular manoeuvre with each other and then quickly followed - perfectly straight and completely quiet- the first two objects.  Their pace was powerful and seemed to have a forcefulness about them that you do not sense when watching airplanes/jets.  They had no blinking lights."

I called for my husband to come out and look at them. I looked through my binoculars using both lenses and it appeared to be the oblong form with a single bar of light the other object was changing colors. I decided to use one of the lenses and then the shape of the object scared the crap out of me. It was like a diamond shaped orb with lights running in sections from top to bottom, it reminded me of a crab shell.   I texted my neighbor who lives .25 miles to the north of us who doesn’t have as many trees surrounding their farmstead as we have, then asked her to go out on her deck to see if she could see anything. She called me back and asked what am I looking for and I heard her husband let out a curse word and said that is what she is talking about. There was o! ne that was not too far from their home and then they counted up to 10 of the objects throughout the area. I got in my vehicle and drove up to their home and after I arrived they said the bigger one had just flown like a comet directly south after hovering for the 15 minutes between the time we had talked on the phone and we I drove into their yard. The objects would hover then slowly move to the west. One of the objects was SE of their home and I thought it was a satellite at first but then it started going in circles like a drone that had a drunk operator but the altitude was too high for a drone. Then it headed straight south. Those that had been in the west started to move south. They all would move a good distance then start hovering again, and continued the pattern. The objects observed would change from white lights to green to red and then stay white while hovering and then change colors again."

I went outside and looked toward Lynchburg Airport and observed 2 V-22 Ospreys getting ready to land at the airport. I noticed it had become completely silent in our neighborhood but when I let my two dogs outside they became skittish and refused to come out.  I looked toward the north and observed another fairly large chevron shaped craft with multi-colored lights about a mile from the Ospreys.  The planes went from going in to land to going back up and heading toward the craft.  The ospreys where heading north to chase the craft but the object picked up speed and was gone out of sight.  I witnessed this for approximately 10 minutes after this I started to hear the dogs in our neighborhood bark and both my dogs where no longer skittish.  I have spent 13 years in law enforcement and have never seen or witnessed anything like! what I saw."

Ran back in to get my cell phone to take pictures but they were going to fast.  Not sure what was going on behind that small cloud.  Sky was clear except that cloud.  Then to the right there was this round object.  And it was gone.  But the lights still continue behind that small cloud.  Strange.  Thought it was the northern lights.

One is bigger and the two others are the same size closer together but still spaced angled downward from the bigger one.  The color of the objects are like the color of the starts but with more of a house light color.  They're similar to stars but they're not, and it's a noticeable difference.  They give off too much light and the position changes periodically and then will eventually be gone at some point.  I've witnessed them blinking too.  I've seen these objects several times.  Sometimes it's just one really bright one and sometimes there's two or 3.  If they are more than one it seems like they usually are spaced in the same kind of way and in an angle away from the biggest.  I'm not the only witness to the objects.

I was traveling 75 mph and as I approached it I looked straight up from my windshield and could see the clear out line silhouette of a triangular blackish object with 3 very red lights on the bottom one on each corner but more in the center not the tip.  It was still night time but the back drop from sky I saw clearly the object..I would say it was over 2 car lengths wide aprox. 35 to 40 feet wide.

I looked around, but there was only one star. “What do you mean?” I asked confused, “There’s only one star where we can see.” Then, she pointed behind the trees at a bright light. It clearly wasn’t a star, but it was too high (I compared it with a house) to be a lamppost, or anything else producing light that was attached to the ground. I layed back down, thinking that it was just some other form of light that is commonly seen, or even an extremely bright star. Anything other than what I saw next after I looked up again."

1139,3/27/20 20:40,Meredith,NH,Light,My friend and I were sitting outside.  My friend noticed a light moving across the sky and pointed it out to me.  I thought it was a satellite.  But withing a few seconds there was another one and then another one and so on.  They all seemed to be flying in the same line. It looked as though they were flying in different lines.  But very close together and very close in line as well.  So much that you would certainly assume it was a group.  The ones we saw first the light seemed constant.  The ones to toward the end seemed to be changing. Almost blinking but it wasnt.  I immediately down went online to a flight tracking site to see the air traffic above my location and the closest plane was more than 40 miles away in a different direction.   And given the terrain where I live. It doesn't allow you to see that far across the horizon.  When I got no where with that I then went to a site showing satellite activity above location.  Again there wasn't anything above us.  After thinking about it more whatever it was or is.  Was at an extremely high altitude.  Much higher than  what passenger planes would fly at.  I honestly have no explanation for it.

However, the recording is good enough to clearly see that the object is not an aeroplane or a helicopter, and if you expand the object you can see the shape is spherical and red in colour, as if on fire.  The object was definitely under control, and definitely not debris from space.

The light looked like it could be a star or even a satelite if you have ever seen one moving. But it definitely wasn't. The movement was not like a satellite, where as a satellite would move slow and in pre programmed line, already knowing the direction. This light was slow, but not like a satellite. This was faster and was moving up then to the left ( south/south east ) moving with an intelligence, not just drifting or shooting through the air. It then disappeared in thin air, faded away. No cloud cover either.The same thing happened again about 10 minutes later, but was moving to the right.

Also at the time these lights went be we seen no other aircrafts in the sky till about 5 minutes after it was over then there were several planes going by lije usual. If anyone else has seen this phenomenon i would love to know.

The second object rotated around the larger original object several times while the original object pulsates with light, then (almost as if it were called back) the second object quickly emerged back with the original and the object took off in the opposite direction on a linear horizontal flight path.

It was also observed to pickup speed before disappearing on the horizon.  No sound, smells, noises, vibrations or otherwise were experienced during this event.  Skies were clear with stars shining with the moon at our backs.  It was as if everything and everyone around was unaware of it's presence.  It seemed as if the object was aware of us observing it.

This object was below moon and to the right when we filmed but you could not see both in video.  Not sure what it was and that’s why I reported.  I’ve never seen this website until I google searched to see if anything else came up about glowing and moving light in the sky tonight.

Object fazes into a ball of light around 8 or stories above the highway and flies at a stalkish slightly faster speed then the car and after 5 seconds fazes out of visibility and disapears.

I went outside to be sure of what I was seeing and sure enough it was.  After a few minutes I realized it was moving very slowly to the East.  I woke my son and he observed it in the distance as well. To rule it out as being a star I observed it continue to slowly move while the background stars remained stationary.  I continued to observe as the object slowly moved East until I lost sight of it.  It was clearly some typ of craft illuminated.

I stopped my car and took one picture but by the time I could get my phone out 2 of the orange lights had disappeared.  There was a bit of a glare from the windshield so I ran up the street to get a better view and took a second picture.  By the time I had taken the second the balls had shifted position.  I immediately got back in the car and raced to my front ends house which was only about 2 minutes or less away from where I took the pictures.  As soon as I got to his house we ran upstairs and got onto his roof and there was nothing to be seen in the direction I saw them in (at this spot we were above the tree line so they would have been more visible).  I was unable to see any shape or an exact altitude of the objects but if I had to estimate i would guess they were around 5-6 thousand feet above the ground.  Upo! n looking at the pictures later I also noticed a rapidly buzzing gray spec that I could not see in the sky before but showed up on camera when I look at the live picture.

At first, I thought it was a planet until I realized it was way outside the ecliptic, and then I thought I needed to check what star could possible be that bright.  I looked away for a moment to check on my dog and when I looked back, I thought it was gone until it reappeared and then seemed to flicker/spark and was gone.  It was not moving so it was definitely not a meteor; however, the flickering out was very similar to the way a meteor breaks apart, but in this case, in a stationary position.  As an object in the atmosphere it would have been low enough that it was some distance away.  It never changed position.  My wife an I saw three of these several years ago and they had the same color which I can never quite decide if its reddish, orangish or pinkish."

It then dissapeared and reappeared a bit further left, once again falling before reappearing closer to the clouds above it.  Since it was now closer, it was evident the object was only around 500 ft in the sky.  Having stopped the car on the side of the road, we were able to hear a faint noise sounding somewhat similar to a helicopter.  Checking local flight radars, I saw no flights in the area, and with the distance to it being less than a thousand feet, a helicopter would not have been as quiet.

When I was looking at the stars and seen a star like light moving slowly across the sky at first I thought it was the space station then realised it wasn’t because there was another one behind it. In total in one straight line with the same distance between them all there was about 10 of these then the last one there was two next to each other.  One of the two was not in the formation but then sped up faster than the rest I watched this fly over I thought it could be planes but as the sky was clear you normally see the flashing.  It was strange and want to know what it could be.  I don’t know where to look for anything that is in the sky The formation was perfect spacing to be meteors and the one at the back was going the same speed then just sped up. I tried to get this on my phone camera but would not pick it up. It was really strange. I thought it could be planes but I often sit outside have a cigarette and watch the stars and I’ve never seen planes pass this route only fly another direction. The star like lights flew over in formation.  Like I’ve said previous when I first seen the first one I thought it was the space station, but had to look twice as I thought another star was moving when I focused I realised there was a straight row of the star lights in formation flying over. If you have a way of checking flight plans in the area or other reports if the same then I would like to know it could of been planes unless it was military but I would of seen the flashing beacons also seemed to high up for planes.  I would like to know what they were. If this is the right person to report this to then any info would be good"

I got through the tunnels that go through a hillside on the road traveled. After I exit the tunnels, I had seen something in my rearview mirror. It was pretty bright and caught my attention. It looked like a falling star possibly but had like what looked to be the after effects of fireworks in the sky. Imagine those two things put together and that's what I had seen. I tried to talk myself out of thinking I seen anything abnormal and chalked it up to im sure it was just a glare from the lights of the tunnels I just exited. It was not until my traveling home that I seen this unidentified object in the sky. I hit about the halfway point traveling home from Elko, back to Carlin. The halfway point as I call it is known as the Hunter exit. It is a remote area, not much there. I get past this exit a ways and still before e! ntering the tunnels and I see this light outside my passenger side window. It looked too bright to be a star, moved too fast to be a plane, and it kind of just hovered really closely over the hillside. I was thinking what it could possibly be but nothing seemed to explain it logically. I studied this object while driving along and finally just decided to focus on the road and quit distracting myself for a while then when I looked over once again a ways down the road, itbwas gone. So, it wasn't until I get off the exit to Carlin, I see this light yet again and start to question my sanity. I stopped at the end of the first exit to Carlin and studied this object for a minute. I then continue home and decided I'm going to record this travel because the light was not disappearing and I start to think Whoa, I am really looking at a possible UFO right now. It cant be. I recorded this short travel from the exit to my home because I'm wanting to tell my parents at this point and the! y will think I'm crazy. I have the series of videos. If anythi! ng im ho ping they will tell me what it is or might be. I reach my home and got out of my vehicle and stare at this unidentified light for a while longer before I decided it was weird the thing had not disappeared yet and that they possibly seen me too and ran in my home. I decided to ignore it and hope they didn't come abduct me someday if I pretended nothing ever happened. (HAHAHA) This is really what was crossing my mind though. It is not until I experience something even more mind blowing the following night that I start to seriously question my sanity. I will describe the next nights event in a seperate report of it's own."

2375,2/7/20 01:30,Comstock Park,MI,Light,"Around 12 am is when i first noticed outside of my window, I’m on the second story of my house and my window looks out north towards Sparta. I was smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke out of the window when the light caught my eye. There is a phone tower around 40 miles that i can see from my house and it has a red light that flashes.From about the same distance but 10 miles to the right of that, I saw a red light that had flashes of green. It looked like the red was rotating around the green light to make an orb shape. I honestly really didn’t think anything of it at first but then i kept watching it and it sat there hovering for about 3-4 minutes. Eventually the light just went out. I left my bedroom at that point and really didn’t think anything of it. I went back into my bedroom at 1:15AM to smoke another cigarette, and I was looking out my window to see if i could spot it again. That’s when i saw it again but this time a lot farther away. It was to! wards Battle Creek. I observed it for about 25 minutes, it was moving side to side and going up and down. I spotted it pretty quickly from red and green lights but it was so far away that it was easy to miss. I watched it slowly move towards the northeast. It was moving up and down and side to side. This is the second time I’ve seen an unidentified object in Comstock Park. The first time i was convinced it was a ufo because of the size of the ship and the tracks it left behind. The tracks dissipated in about 10 seconds. This time I’m not sure what I saw because i got to observe it for so long. I can tell you I’ve never seen anything like it though. I’ve never seen something in an orb shape hover in the sky with that light pattern. I am a 21 year old sober man who is in relatively good shape. I have no history of mental illness."

Then we started to notice very small lights appearing out of a cloud up an to the right of the big bright light which seemed to be coming out one after another non stop an moving in a straight line an evenly spaced apart moving quite fast above and past the big bright light that was stationary in the sky. Then the small light were seeming to disappear behind another cloud on the opposite side of the big bright light an were not coming back out the other side of this cloud.  Which they should have been because the cloud was quite small an their were literally at least 30 to an infinite amount of these small lights moving across the night sky just one after another constantly appearing out of this cloud an following the others in this evenly spaced straight line over top of the b! ig bright light an then disappearing again behind the cloud on the opposite side of it. An what was crazy is after we watched for aleast 20 minutes to a half hour an counted anywhere from 30 to 50 small lights moving before we had finally decided to leave for the grocery store we had also noticed 2 or 3 random similar small lights just randomly moving above our car aswell. But the craziest part was when we finally left an got down the road and got close to our destination we saw a city cop car and a sheriff's car parked on the side of the road next to a huge wide open field in which 4 or more police officers were standing outside of there vehicles, two next to the vehicles on the side of the road an 2 or possibly more others were standing in the field off the other side of the road and they were all looking up in the sky towards the same big bright star that we had been looking towards and had saw the small moving lights over before we had left our house just minutes before! . So I'm pretty positive they had seen what we saw aswell an I! 've been waiting to read about it in our local news paper or something today  but haven't seen or heard anything yet but I'll definitely keep checking cause it was the craziest thing I've ever seen..."

2456,2/1/20 11:45,Santa Paula,CA,Other,"I was driving on Telegraph Rd. in the city of Santa Paula, heading in a northeastern direction. I was speaking on the phone with my boyfriend when I looked up at the clear blue sky and saw a silver bullet shaped object with no wings or any other identifiable features. I then noticed a slightly smaller silver bullet that appeared to be “towed"" by the first object. I commented to my boyfriend that it looked strange and I could not identify what I saw. I then saw a third silver bullet-looking object that was slightly smaller in size flying in perfect formation with the first two silver bullets. It eventually became apparent that I was looking at 3 silver bullet shaped objects, one smaller than the other in consecutive order, flying in perfect formation. I wanted badly to photograph the objects but I was driving at the time and had my eyes peeled on both the road and the sky. When I told my boyfriend everything I saw, I looked back up again from the road an! d the three objects had vanished in the sky. There was absolutely no clouds in the sky that day and the sky was crystal blue and clear. The objects seemed like they were flying a few thousand feet in the air and they were not flying fast at all. As soon as the objects vanished, I was undeniably dumbfounded and commented to my boyfriend how I could not believe what I just saw because one minute they were there flying at a moderate rate and the next they had completely vanished as though they had not even existed. There were other aircraft in the sky but not close enough to the vicinity of the objects I saw. There were 2 other aircraft I remember seeing flying in the sky. The neighborhood consists of crops and fields with a slither of the Santa Paula mountains and Santa Clara river nearby."

When we shined a strobing light towards them, they moved closer but got dimmer. Some lights were orange, some white, some yellow, and they often changed colors and brightness.  We also used night vision to observe, which revealed beams that looked almost like search lights, scanning the fields below us.  Even with the naked eye you could see the lights scanning through the trees.  They moved smoothly and quickly, like drones almost but they aren't drones.  The sounds accompanying the lights were mostly a constant hum like a car engine running and occasionally revving, and both of us because separately heard what! sounded like water running toward us.  However we are on top of a mountain with nothing but cow pasture and Forest around us, with no streams or creeks or ponds.  Honestly very freaked out.

I didnt think much about it; butI did have the thought that it seemed to be coming down slower than most meteors.

This event was witnessed by myself and my son and daughter it was unnerving to say the least. I could not give them an explanation for what we had witnessed as I didn't want to jump to conclusions. Suffice it to say they were not satellites as they were moving much too quickly. But they were at the same height in the sky that one would expect to see a satellite. Also they made course corrections as they travelled from horizon to horizon in minutes. This is the first time I have seen so many at once.

They seemed to be slowly drifting SouthEast in a perfectly straight line, evenly spaced apart. I estimate that the altitude was very high ( above 10,000 FT).  Using binoculars, I could see the stars moving behind the formation. I also detected faint Red and Green lights luminating from the objects. One of the objects appeared to be moving around the other objects.  After 20 minutes the formation became obscure. I managed to take a good picture of the event with my iPhone."

2566,1/24/20 02:00,Pawtucket,RI,Circle,I saw a flying saucer outside of a retail company but that was not the first a few years ago I saw some outside of my new apartment two of them. I have also saw the what appears to be a Martian with dark eyes a dark whole in its forehead and it looks as if it has duplicated itself. Also another with orange tinted eyes with brown skin another that is invisible that only shows its mouth and nose. I have been noticing whenever it’s around I sense it’s around the air thickens almost as if it is suffocating you to make you hallucinate. I am very afraid. I would really appreciate it if I could get some help. Also. Around the time I saw the ufo in the front yard I also noticed that there was a black substance coming from the shower head in my apartment. I would not be reporting this if I did not feel like my life and the children life’s were in danger of disappearing. It has been manipulating the situation to make me wonder wether or not my kids have been abducted ! or are going to be abducted have been and using that. By forcing me to abide by its rules. I have night terrors that I hustled started to have of horrific murders and it bringing people back to life a dead body’s roaming earth. It also has been messing with the supernatural acting like the devils wife. That sounds outlandish but I am very sure about why. Please help I’ve also spotted these things in other states that I have traveled through whether it be that it has been following me through them. Like mass cot Georgia Virginia and South Carolina. I have pictures of distortion and video of a loud voice that was manipulated. I still have the video but you can not hear the voice anymore.

Then it went up and stoped then after a bit it came toward us and it was lower than the tree line and it had more of a quiet vibration noise as it flew over us slowly.  Then when it was gone we heard a airplane and there was a airplane headed toward where the air craft just came from.  But the airplane was loud unlike the air craft we just saw.   Then we went inside and as I settled down I saw the light again and I ran back outside and the same light coming down with a flashing green and going back up thing happen.  Then it went in a straight line to the right And then it went up and then it came toward us.

He was looking at his phone and I was just sitting there looking out the windshield for no particular reason waiting for my phone to load a game.  My phone acted strange.  It lagged in strange way I'd not experienced before.  So, I was randomly looking out the windshield waiting for it to load, smoking my cigarette.  It was a pitch black night with no stars visible.  All of a sudden a glowing green oval orb appeared in the sky.  It had a darker green spot in the center of it.  It hovered in one place, after it just appeared out of nowhere.  It took my breath away and I stared in shock at first then I startled as it then moved in a perfect ark manuever to the right and down.  I gasped at that point and was about to tell my fiancee look at what I'm seeing!  As soon as I gasped and was in shock, I started to get my fiancees attention to look!.  Then, it just disappeared before he could look up.  Whether its light went out or took off fast, idk.  I googled green orbs to find out if it was a meteor or ball lighting but meteors have a tail like a comet and ball lightening only appears w thunder storms.  I searched the internet for pics or videos of green orb unidentified objects in the sky and all looked very similar to what I saw.  I saved two pics off of the web as they look very similar, nearly identical to what I saw.  The only difference is the inside of the green orb I saw had a darker green dot in center vs the white dot in the pics I found on the web."

2611,1/21/20 00:00,Gouverneur,NY,Unknown,at about 12:50 or so I was sitting down with my girlfriend to put together a puzzle . shortly after we began separating out the edge pieces we heard an odd sound with a little prompting from my girlfriend I got up and looked out the window . across the street above the neighbors house was an odd red light that was steady and yellow light and green light blinking moved across the sky slowly .  I moved from window to window in the house observing these lights that were formed in a triangular fashion . and then we both watched the lights from the last window as it drifted towards the North .  the sound was almost indescribable . it certainly was no helicopter but the movements that made was like that of a helicopter it was absolutely no air plane . even one propelled by a propeller such as a crop duster would not move that slowly as for it being a drone I highly doubt it it was much larger than that I have no idea what this object was so I called for help to try! to identify it . I am skeptical of such things as aliens and UFOs so with much reluctance I attempted contacting Air Traffic Control and  then  online found the number to this site . less than an hour later we heard a similar sound and rush outside with the camera on the phone ready tape the same sort of object moving in another Direction nevertheless the camera was too weak to pick it up . it was an extraordinary clear night with no moonlight plenty of stars shining bright . ambient light was at a very low level and for that matter at my back . I spend a lot of time looking at the night sky and have never seen a sight so stunning or heard a soud so terrifying.  truly A.M.

They all moved in uniform and at the same speed and there was no noise associated with this event. As they went up they curved and then they started to disappear as they got further up in altitude. I tried to take pix with my cell phone but my pix turned out black.

2660,1/17/20 17:48,Kamloops (Canada),BC,Light,"I saw through the windshield of my car,a very bright white light hovering stationary to the North,my right,as I faced West in the empty drive through at the Tim Horton cafe.  The light stayed motionless and absolutely steady at an elevation of 800 to 1000 feet I'm guessing, in a blowing snowstorm, and I at first took it to be a helicopter,but felt it looked more like the planet Venus? I stopped and stared for a couple minutes and it didn't change, so I took four pictures through my window and tried to roll down my passenger side for a better shot.  The window was froze and as I did this the object seemed to come to life and a white and orangey red set of navigation lights came on,as it remained motionless.  I took it to be an airplane or helicopter and I was just pulling forward in the drive through and figured I would stop and  get out for a better shot.  After I did this the object had disappeared from view.  No sound was heard at all.  The total time was fi! ve minutes and I only saw one object, but in my pics there is two.  The bright star viewed is an egg shaped dull white with a square in the center and underneath is an orange disc.  I went back the following night to see if a streetlight could have made the orange disc but there is none there.  I was the only witness,nobody else was around.  I am  an unpaid caregiver with a background in radio dispatching and licensed AERONAUTICAL restricted operator.  As such I don't believe what I saw was an aircraft.  Thank you for your time and taking my report."
2661,1/17/20 14:41,Lakewood,WA,Oval,"I have these two objects floating above my apartment complex that have been there for several weeks more like two months. They are only seen if you look through my live security camera feed. You cannot see them if you look with your naked eye. At first I thought this was simply a glitch or a pierce of dirt on my window that was in the view of my camera. To rule both the possibility of both objects out of being either dirt or a anomaly in the security feed I had or security provider go in and do some testing of our camera and there systems which evening was fine and they said those two objects are very strange like and they are not produced by anything on the system and your camera is not having any issues they suggested I contact our police and get them to contact the property authorities for further follow-up because they thought perhaps it was UFO'S and them being there in the same spot for weeks, cloaked and just hovering there then probably they are up t! o no good could be monitoring or could be doing tests that's a human population is not aware of it at this time because if they were just floating through then they would not require to be cloaked for so long or stay in the same spot somebody knows something and I should let people know quote and just hovering there then probably they are up to no good could be monitoring or could be doing tests that the human population is not aware of at this time because if they were just floating through then they would not require two be quote for so long or stay in the same spot somebody knows something and I should let people know I thought dang it was person is very open and I'm glad I got that technician because they did not see me as crazy and so I took two photos and they both are seen in the photo. I did try and zoom in to see if I could get a better view on the camera but both objects are blurry and no matter how close you get to them with the zoom they remain blurry. I tried t! o use binoculars and they were blurry but also it looked as if! a field of energy like you would see on those tv episodes of star trak when the enterprise activates the shield you get that energy field well this looks like a similar version but only real and it is blurry and their are even lights that illuminate of and on behind this blurry field it's producing which is even more strange. The object on the right side hovering lower than the left is black kinda half moon shape with these spike things coming out of the top and bottom of this thing and the other object to the left and above looks oval shaped and shall black. I thought perhaps it had a vortex behind it our something cause it's dark in color and I've heard of these things traveling at great speed using a type of hyper jump Assisi again something the sci-fi artist dream up and put in the tv episodes based on space travel we seen on television. Lastly, is like to point out that these objects are just sitting in the sky for weeks even months never moving in the daytime you can see them! fade in and out of the clouds as they pass by aha at night they give of a very dim glow your can definitely tell they are not stars and I have also seen four other objects appear above the left oval shape object they were evenly spaced apart and went in a straight line above one another just sit there for a better part of a day then they were gone but the they never really came fully into view like you see these two they were very faint and a white color. I have enclosed two photos which are the same view but seconds taken seconds apart look just above the roof on the building in view you will see a few tree tops but if you look to the right of the top of the tree extending up from the roof top of to the right of it you will see the moon shaped spiked object and left above that tree the oval shaped one. What does everyone think about this. What could they be doing just sitting there for months now?   ,"

2664,1/17/20 05:30,Princeton,NJ,Triangle,"I am an educator at a boarding school in Princeton, NJ.  I was scheduled to interview prospective students by skype from China so I was driving to campus at about 5:30 am on Friday, Jan. 17, 2020 when I noticed a strange object in a jet black pre-dawn sky.  At first I thought it was clouds partially covering the moon, but the object was far too big for that.  I realized quickly that it looked like a huge floating platform just hovering in the sky above a large shopping center near my house.  It was black and solid, blacker than the dark winter sky, with white, and the occasional red and green lights irregularly placed around it so it looked strange and caught my eye.  Since it was off at an angle and above me, it wasn’t clear if it was a rectangle shape or a triangle.  It looked like a gigantic sound platform like you see at concerts but much bigger than that, hanging silently in the air.  As I drove down the road with the object hovering to my left, I could ! see that it was ridiculously huge hanging there, dwarfing the large shopping center below it.  As soon as I could, I pulled off the road, rolling my window down to hear any sounds.  I couldn’t calculate how high it was in the sky, but I’d say it was somewhere between where a helicopter would fly but well above the top of the shopping center.  It was much bigger than the center and had no sound.  I stared at it for 10 minutes trying to figure out what it was.  I’ve never seen anything like it.  Finally, it silently drifted off beyond the tree line and I drove off to work so I wouldn’t be late for my calls."

Orb would levitate, then move slowly downward to horizon, then accelerate straight up at high rate of speed.  At one point the orb shot straight up, then straight down, then upwards again.  Through binoculars, I could see 5 individual bright lights inside the main orb.  This activity lasted at least 2 hrs, then orb accelerated upward and left.  Hover time (without moving) over the ocean would sometimes last 10 mins.  Movement aeemed to be in 90° trajectories."

Definitely not aircraft (Air Force veteran) but passenger aircraft lights where present in area, lights seemed to be higher than aircraft flight altitude but we do get a lot of air traffic coming and going from DIA over our area so can’t be sure of altitude.  My first thought it was drones that has been in our state news recently but my opinion changed once the lights started to disappear to the west.  Rough degrees of travel was from 240 degrees traveling to 270 degrees roughly before fading out.  Flight path seemed to be the same for all, with roughly the same spacing in between and was just a continuous stream of them with aircraft traveling opposite direction but close to same flight altitude maybe a hair higher.

Right above me a little to the west I saw a strange orb of lights that seemed to change from orange to whole to red and the lights were hovering. I'm a pilot and look up at planes all the time. My first thought was a drone with some weird lights attached. There was no sound. I stared up at it for about 1 min. Then it started moving. The lights started to fade and now I could see at large black rectangle moving slowly to the east. It was a full moon and scattered clouds, but the sky was a gray color with the full moon. A couple white lights winked on this black rectangle then it went completely black. It was such a dark  dark black color. Initially I thought this object was low, maybe 500 ft, but as it glided silently across the sky I saw it went above the the broken clouds. I've never seen anything glide so smoothly. It was the shape of a Hersey bar. It picked move slowly as it glided away completely black but I coul! d clearly see it's shape in the light night sky I watched it until it moved behind clouds. I was really in shock. I thought that's either some very advanced secret aircraft of ours or a UFO. It was amazing. I went inside and told a family member a nd texted a friend. I went on the internet to see if there was any news about this. I even called one of the local news networks to ask them if they had gotten any reports. I also check the weather to see what the cloud layer height was to get an idea of how big this really was. The pilot wether briefing I read said the clouds were scattered at 9500 feet. This object was above them and went through them at times. Based on that altitude Id guess the object was about 100 ft x 50 ft. I'll never forget this sighting. I already believed we are being visited by other planets. Now I can say I know for sure. This had to be a UFO."

All were headed in exact same direction, west, above the clouds. All moved silently at same speed. Came inside before all the activity was finished.  I thought maybe they were a meteor shower, but there were no trails.  Thought about calling airport to the north of town, but it was after hours.  Ive never seen a drone at night, so i cant agree or disagree with what she said. I was trying to find out information online about military action, but i found nothing recent.

I kept my eyes on it until I started passing trees that blocked my view and when I turned right on North Campus Way to be able to see it again, the object was gone.  It was right after 12 noon.

But then it leveled of at about 80 feet.  And in a blink of an eye it was atleast 3 miles away then just disappeared.

I went back inside to grab my phone to start videotaping the event.  I told my husband who came outside and he could not explain what it was either.  As I started videotaping, the object  changed shape from a star bright light appearance and started moving.  The object became a circle shape that was rotating and it was moving in a circular pattern in the sky.  Flashes of white and red were emitting from the object.  The object then moved straight up and forward in the sky passing over our house and went out of sight.  I have vid! eo of the object moving."

As it moved towards us,it began to get difficult to keep it in camera view.  It seemed to continually climb in altitude.  Eventually becoming just a spec. In addition,it flew in an irregular pattern.  Coming somewhat straight then into a curve as though it was going around the clouds!  Also, it began to move quite faster."

As it left very quickly it seemed as though one side acquired more objects and they had no lights as if it was trying to hide from being seen.   was a second bigger object right after the first group but this one was a very large triangle with 3 rounded lights one on each corner but the lights weren't bright at all.  I could still see the entire object but those ones emitted no sounds.  It followed the same route as the group of objects before it.  One more star like object followed the second on the same direction towards the Pacific Ocean.the speed of the last object was very fast but definitely not a asteroid.

Our first impression was it was a rancher in a helicopter searching for cattle. after about 30-45 minutes we watched as this worked its way around the lake.  As it started to come around our side of the lake we suddenly became fearful, as whatever it was made absolutely no sound. I started my car and drove to the highway without my lights. When reaching the road I turned on my lights and started at high speed towards Laramie.  Immediately this craft raised up and was over us almost instantly.

I reacquired the object looking  through the binoculars and could see that it was an orangish color and was definitely rotating at a steady slow pace.  It seemed to be shaped like a parachute canopy.  I watched it through the binoculars for about 1 min before I lost sight of it due to a tree line behind my home.  I'm a professional pilot with 15 years experience and It was definitely not an airplane or helicopter.
